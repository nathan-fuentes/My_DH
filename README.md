# Individual Project
For this project I chose to research obesity around the globe and specifically what external factors may contribute to this rise as well as look at it more from a personal and individual perspective on the people who are attempting to prevent obesity by seeing the struggles they face and their approach to it. To see how fast this rise is I gathered data by the World Health Organization to plot the US and global rise of obesity from 1990-2019 using seaborn and to see how much of an issue this is I plotted mortality rate % of obesity related deaths using data gathered by The Global Burden of Disease Study. To get external factors I gathered data from the CDC and found the mean obesity rates based on income level, education level, and race/ethnicity. To look at this from a personal standpoint I used reddit api to gather the most frequent words and perform tf-idf on the words based on text from the top 20 hottest posts on r/loseit including the title, description, and comment. Overall I found that there are many external factors that do have a high impact on determining if one falls in the category of obesity with many of these factors not being a choice for many individuals. I also found that reddit tends to talk more objectively as well as offer a small support system for those who are fortunate enough to pursue it; however I think this shows that we need to expand the macro information we found in conversations and all internet platforms.
