    "# Introduction:\n",
    "### In recent years we have seen a large spike of obesity within the around the world and while many will come to the conclusion that the reason for the spike of obesity is that people are getting a lot \"lazier\" and \"choose\" not to improve their health, I believe that there is many external factors that contributes to one's weight that they don't have much power in choosing such as a stressful enironment, less gifted metabolism at birth, economic factors, and lack of a support system. My goal for this project is to use data analysis on the spikes of external issues within the country that contribute to this health problem and take opinions of reddit users who themselves may have dealt with obesity and see what they believe lead to their obesity and see what people suggest can help solve this and will also prove how much of an impact these external factors have and find what exactly are the most common external problems.\n"

       " 'I started walking 10,000 steps a day and truly didn’t think it would do much for weight loss. I was thinking it’s good for heart health and mental health so that’s why I was doing it. I also figured that I barely exercise so at least walking all of these steps would be some sort of activity. Anyways, I’ve been walking 10,000 steps a day for 3 weeks now and I’ve lost 5 pounds! I’m shocked! Everyone told me it wouldn’t do much for me. I have been trying to eat healthier as well (I have an awful sweet tooth), but to be honest the biggest change has been the walking. Reaching the goal also really helps me feel accomplished and lifts my spirits which I think inspires my slightly better eating choices too. I cannot recommend walking for your health more. It is SO helpful in SO many ways and I can definitely say it has been a game changer for me these past few weeks.\\n\\nTip for anyone looking to start: I chunk it out into five 20-minute walks scattered throughout my day and that gets me to the 10,000 in a way that doesn’t seem so daunting :)',\n",
       " 'You rock! Walking is a great help on this journey. It was a big part of my weight loss in many ways. \\n\\nFirst thing it did was burn a few more calories. This wasn\\'t much but walking everyday for 4 miles (10K steps) burned about 250-300 calories for me. \\n\\nSecond thing it did, gave me something I could actively do each day for my weight loss. Diet changes are mostly about eating less. I found eating at a deficit to be mostly not eating as much as I did before. Doing less, essentially. Walking was something I could choose to add in, go out and do, as opposed to not snacking at night. \\n\\nThird, it was a distraction, a change of routine. An evening walk instead of sitting on the couch snacking really helped me a number of times to... not snack. \\n\\nLastly, the steps ended up being a reason to stick to plan less that effort was squandered. Inner voice went something like, \"You walked for a hour this morning, don\\'t waste that by going off your plan.\"\\n\\nKeep on steppin\\' and losin\\'.',\n",

Maybe that’s something I’ll focus on more when I’m back from my holiday.

When I\\'d posted two years ago, I was immensely depressed, frustrated and at my lowest point.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t feel like peeping my post history, I\\'ll give a rundown:\\n\\nAt around age twelve, I was prescribed antipsychotic medications for a condition I ended up not even having. This isn\\'t a psych subreddit, so I won\\'t delve into that agonizing ordeal, but it turns out that my problem required therapy, NOT medication, and certainly not something so intense as an anti-psych.Five years of abilify (with two of those being by injection, too!) later, and a complete overhaul of my diet, my body was ruined. I weighed over 120 pounds over the ideal weight for my height.I went from eating literal garbage as a teenager, to starving myself in my early twenties, to eating consistently clean for a year, at pristine, weighed CICO.\\n\\nI began to work out despite feeling exhausted. Why wouldn\\'t the scale move?\\n\\nI was eating at a healthy deficit, why wasn\\'t I seeing a decline?\\n\\nSure, fluctuations happened, but after a meal, no matter how low-density or accurately weighed and measured, I\\'d climb several pounds over two days, only drop down once i\\'d beaten my appetite into submission and rest at an absolutely unsustainable caloric intake.At my worst, I was taking in 600 calories a day,  with a side of self loathing.\\n\\nI was a burnt match;  I wanted to scream into the void but was worried that people would accuse me of lying or not \\'actually\\' eating in deficit a\\'la many posts around r/loseit in the same vein as the one i\\'d  written before.\\n\\nI made the decision to log off of online weight loss resources and book an appointment with a new doctor and explain my problem.I lucked out; the most incredible doctor i\\'d had the pleasure of meeting with saw me that same month.\\n\\nHe was personable, empathetic and had experience with this sort of thing a handful of times, a few patients ago. We met with the intent to discuss weight loss as it\\'s done by the books.Surely, I was doing something wrong?As soon as I mentioned why my weight began to climb, his face dropped.\\n\\nHe asked if I was constantly fatigued, I said yes. He asked about my final dosage of abilifiy, discussed my initial misdiagnosis. He looked at my calorie tracker and just shook his head. He ordered labs.\\n\\nAfter collecting labs and realizing that evidently, I was not sustaining myself on Mcdonald\\'s and fried Oreos, he decided to set me on track to get a gastric bypass.\\n\\nWith his referral, I made an appointment with a bariatric center a state over and got the ball rolling. It took six months. Continuous appointments With the guidance of healthcare professionals in remote-limbo talking me through nutrition education resources, I had my weight analyzed like coordinates to some nebulous mystery; as if it were a problem willpower couldn\\'t break.\\n\\nA little under a year ago, I  got the procedure. It hasn\\'t been easy. Even with therapy, it was hard to shake the feeling that I took the easy way out.\\n\\nI worked hard. I am working hard. I tried my best, and it paid off; I\\'ve lost 80 lbs— I\\'m about 20 lbs away from my goal weight.\\n\\nI am fit. I have some loose skin, but it\\'s a reminder that i\\'m fucking doing it. Even if I needed medical help to begin; I tear it up at the gym, I stick with my diet, and I never, ever gave up and ate the tub of gelato.  I\\'m losing a consistent 1-2 lbs and eating an appropriate amount for my GW.Sometimes you just can\\'t do it alone.By all means, start with CICO. I just want to remind everyone that CICO isn\\'t always a one-size-fits-all solution; especially when your body chemistry and hormones have been destroyed by an improper diagnosis and medication that\\'s now a thorny nest of class-actions and complaints regarding long-term weight loss problems.\\n\\nI apologize for how long this was, I hope it wasn\\'t a slog, and I hope I can help anyone in a similar boat. I wanna add that this isn\\'t to say CICO is bad or ineffective; sometimes you gotta dig a little deeper and get a Medical professional\\'s opinion. You just might have been fucked over by big pharma, or something!  \\n\\n\\n  \\nEDIT:   \\nSince people are kind of misunderstanding my post, it\\'s not to say CICO doesn\\'t work, once again. It\\'s that if your body isn\\'t one of typical health, like mine, and you had an issue with how your body absorbs neutrients, sometimes there\\'s something deeper going on. I didn\\'t eat 600 cal every day, a week, as if some would imply: It looked more like, 900, 900, 800, 900, 1000, 900,  \\\\*fuck it, I\\'m exhausted by the idea of eating. 600.\\\\*, for a \\\\*long time\\\\*  \\nThe fact that I was having days where I didn\\'t want to eat at all because I was frustrated by my work not getting me anywhere is more the point, not that \\\\*cico doesn\\'t work\\\\*   \\nThese medications have trails of problems with them, especially when you don\\'t inherently \\\\*have\\\\* the issue they\\'re meant to treat, and to give it to someone who\\'s pre-adolecent, essentially. That has disastrous effects on the body. I understand that many might doubt my claim or want to look for a silver lining, but this wasn\\'t a diet issue, this was a health issue.  ',\n",

I think that I am and have decided to stop getting her food, a lot of people suggested showing I care in other ways and that seems like a nice idea. She still doesn’t want to lose weight and will continue to order food (she does earn her own money and pay for this, a lot of people thought I was supporting her financially which just isn’t true). I also kept getting asked what capacity the scales were, they were 400lbs. \\n\\nI talked to her about this and she was upset at first but we kind of talked more about how I felt i’d caused her to gain more weight than she would have otherwise. We then had quite a long talk about that, she said after we first moved in together she was gaining weight fast enough to really notice it. Apparently I did always bring her a lot of food that she probably wouldn’t have got for herself, she said part of it was she’d always been quite embarrassed to get too much food for herself but that me giving it to her made her feel like it was ok. She didn’t blame me, she found it cute that I’d always bring her something. \\n\\nShe did also talk a little more about how the weight is causing her pain, she is also quite worried about how much harder she's finding things. It was pretty clear she just wanted some support for that, so I’m not going to try and push it further. I do know it’ll get worse but I don’t really know what to do the help. I think this has been positive step for us, and hopefully she won’t gain much more weight without me giving her more food.\",\n",
       " \"Not to sound cruel, but if she's already passed the 400lb mark and continues to gain (with her health/mobility issues starting already)  you have to ask yourself if you're willing to go from *companion* to *caregiver*....\",\n",

But she's also fully accepted it and is perfectly content with it; she's picked her hill and is willing to die on it.\\n\\nAs others have said, ask yourself if you're willing to go from partner to caregiver, because from the looks of it, this is going to get much worse before, if at all, it gets better. She's very soon going to depend on you for many things, and might even lose the ability to do her job and be financially independent.\",\n",

Encouraging her to go to therapy or potentially address disordered eating habits could be really helpful. Eating disorders are not just anorexia or bullemia, but also binge eating disorder, for example. I was not able to lose weight until I addressed my trauma and my eating disorder (and I was struggling with morbid obesity for years). I am convinced that no one gets that heavy unless there is an underlying mental health issue, or sometimes a medical issue like thyroid issues for example.  \\n\\nAt the same time, if that doesn't work, there's only so much you can do to help someone who doesn't want to be helped. And it's really hard to see someone you love suffer or dig themselves a grave.

My weight made me unhappy so I ate, and eating made me weigh more and more. \\n\\nAs a 6’ tall person, I know how difficult normal things are at that weight.

Sitting in the house and never leaving will never fix this. She has to want to fix this on her own, but she needs to be challenged by being shown what she can’t do because of her weight.

I’m a chronic pain patient, so I’m going to take a brief detour to talk about pain. \\n\\n I just graduated from a pain management class where I learned a ton. Movement is *so important* for handling pain. But it feels counterintuitive, and instead people move less. And then they hurt more. It’s a spiral that traps people in their own homes. And when you’re trapped and in pain … it’s really, really easy to turn to food for comfort. \\n\\n100% unrelated to any weight loss, she may want to look into moving for pain management. Not join a gym or anything major, just whatever she can do. Even if it’s to the mailbox and back. Doing movements to help preserve range of motion in her joints. (A doctor’s help is very useful here, to help distinguish between pain that is information and pain that isn’t.)\\n\\nAlso look at TENS units for pain; the TENS 7000 is what my pain doctor recommended and it’s around $30 on Amazon. Super effective; has cut way down on my need for otc painkillers. \\n\\nDetour over. \\n\\nI’d strongly consider therapy, both individual and couple’s therapy. This is a big stressor for the relationship; it’s worth getting some professional support involved.\\n\\nI … look, I am not here to throw stones.

       " 'My tips for losing 22 lbs (loose CICO, not hating myself, paying attention to my emotions)',\n",
       " 'Hi all!\\n\\nI\\'ve been wanting to post something like this for a while, but since I hadn\\'t lost all that much I didn\\'t think anyone would want to read it. Well, now I\\'m 10 kg (22 lbs) down (7 kg to go), and I think that qualifies me to post my advice, haha.\\n\\nI\\'ve lost the weight without really counting calories. I\\'ve had bursts of strict tracking but they never last longer than a couple of days, so now I\\'m just mostly playing it by ear as far as calories are concerned. I will sometimes (rarely) look at the packaging to see how many calories I\\'m consuming and I\\'ve remembered the calories for some of the things I eat often. I also did IF for a while, and while it was a great \"gateway\" into weightloss, I have continued to lose even when not paying attention to when I eat. These are some of the tips and tricks that have worked for me, and I would love to read yours.\\n\\n1. I\\'ve stopped denying myself things I like. If I want potato chips, I buy the smallest bag there is (50g), so that when it\\'s gone it\\'s gone and there\\'s no temptation left in my home. Yes, a big bag is cheaper per kilo than a small one, but that\\'s just my motivation to not indulge too often.\\n2. I try to eat more protein rich foods, since I\\'ve found that they fill me up for longer - an apple and a tbsp of peanut butter leaves me feeling full (and craving free) longer than a bowl of pasta. I would never eat an apple and pb instead of a full meal, but I have it often as a snack.\\n3. When eating a carb rich meal (rice, pasta, potatoes), I eat half as much of the carb as I would normally, and just add veggies, eg. where I would normally eat 2 cups of cooked rice, I\\'ll have just a cup and then a cup of, say, broccoli.\\n4. If I\\'m having bread, I make sure to cut a very thin slice, like half or a third of the normal slice for me, then I toast it so that it doesn\\'t fall apart, and also I love crunchy, toasted bread.\\n5. I\\'m not super strict with this, but I\\'ve learned to cook without oil or with just a tbsp or so for the whole meal (for two). Fats are important, though, but I\\'d rather get my daily portion from things that I enjoy eating - a piece of chocolate, some avocado, nuts...\\n6. If I\\'m craving something super high in calories, like a doughnut, a bigger bag of chips, a slice of cake, I eat it as a meal, not in addition to my three daily meals. Then, when (if) I get hungry later, I\\'ll have some fruit or veggies.\\n7. Most important: When I\\'m craving food but I\\'m not hungry, I\\'ll have a little talk with myself. Why do I want to eat this? Is it because I\\'m bored? Find something to do. Is it because I\\'m watching a movie and I need to keep my hands busy? Crochet something. Is it because I don\\'t want to work and eating is a good excuse not to? Just do a little bit of work or find something else to do. Is it because I\\'m sad/tired/in a bad mood and my usual reaction to this is to eat? What else would put me in a better mood? A bath, a nap, reading a book? Great, go do that. Sometimes it\\'s not that deep, I just want something because I want something and that\\'s fine too, but it pays to figure out the why of your cravings.\\n8. Second most important: It got easier once I convinced myself that I\\'m not a bad/lazy/unworthy person because I\\'m overweight. When losing weight became just something to do to make my life easier, once the emotional/self worth component was out, it somehow wasn\\'t that hard to just not eat as much.\\n9. I\\'ve stopped beating myself up for going over my calorie budget. A deficit is a deficit so as long as I\\'m under my TDEE most days, it\\'s all good.\\n\\nStay at it, I believe in you. We\\'ve got this!\\n\\nEDIT: It took me three months to lose the 10 kg.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Thank you for the silver!!!',\n",

I have been similar but slower, this time I just decided that I was doing it slow and steady and lost 20kg in about a year, not beating myself up but not stopping either.

       " \"Hey all! It's my first post here but have to say, I'm enjoying reading this sub a lot, there's a lot of amazing people on here and tons of great advice! I apologise for the long post but it's a loaded topic for me!\\n\\nI'm 31F, 5'2 (160cm), SW 160lbs / 73kg, CW 152 lbs / 69kg, GW... 121 lbs / 55kg maybe? Not sure about goal weight yet, just trying to get to 132 lbs / 60kg first. \\n\\nI've lost the initial 4kg / 8lbs over the last month. On google I read it's a good initial result but hope it's not too fast due to my history which I'm about to explain.\\n\\nSo, my story is tricky but unfortunately very common. Had a pretty bad ED when I was in my late teens when I starved myself on 800 calories a day (at most) for nearly a year, with some regular binge eating due to eating almost nothing most of the time. I was underweight and had no period for months. Moved to uni and started eating again, somehow maintained a healthy weight for a few years until I got into a long term relationship which, coupled with the pandemic, caused me to gain the majority of the current excess weight. I'm not blaming my ex partner in any way and I accept all responsibility, it was just the wrong situation for me. I recognised it was bad and decided to move on, which was extremely difficult.\\n\\nAnyway, we broke up and I moved out 3 months ago. Going back to old healthier habits has been slow but definitely easier than when I was sharing a home with someone who was a bad influence. Going to the doctors for a check up a month ago was a shock when I discovered my starting weight, I honestly had no idea I was this heavy (been avoiding scales throughout my 20s). Before anyone says it's not that bad, I'm only 5'2! And yes, I realise it's not a big deal and it can be worse, but I'd like to not let it get worse. \\n\\nSo I decided to get healthier and for once do it for me and not for anyone else, in a healthy, sustainable way. Overcoming the ED had left me happy I was at least eating well, but it seems like too much body positivity can also be a bad thing because I clearly let myself go. \\n\\nI'm now on 1300 calories a day roughly after using several online calculators, trying to figure out a sustainable way to lose it not too quickly but not too slowly, and keep it off. It mostly comes from protein, wholegrains, a lot of veg, some fruit, legumes, bit of cheese/yogurt, olive oil/avocados, some dark chocolate/healthier snacks etc - mostly healthy stuff. I like having some drinks with friends (I'm in the UK - this culture here is pretty brutal!) but it's no more than a few times a month, so apart from the occasional glass of wine with dinner (which I count) I try to keep it to a minimum as I know it's empty calories. It's all work in progress, trying to take it easy on myself.\\n\\nI also run, walk quite a bit and do arm resistance and floor stomach exercises 3-4 times a week. I've had a few 'cheat' days during this month as well when I didn't count calories due to socialising/festivals - nothing too out of control but I just didn't bother. This time round I'm not letting those days get the better of me, I know if I'm on track 80% of the time then it's all good. I think it's a good compromise rather than living like a monk forever. Slipping for a day or two (from that ridiculous starving regime) used to make me extremely depressed and binge eat. This time round it hasn't happened! (yet)\\n\\nSo I guess my question is - do you think I'm on the right track? Is the weight loss too fast/slow? Are the calories okay for my height/weight/activity level? Most importantly, how do I do this without slipping into ED territory again, if anyone has any advice? I don't really have money for nutritionists/therapists right now so would have to manage on my own for now.\\n\\nI'm really sick of feeling sorry for myself, hating my body and struggling with self-esteem and mental health. I'm already feeling lighter and my mind is a bit clearer, so here's to hoping I stick with it this time - it's also partially why I'm making this post, to hold myself accountable. I see it as self care and even a form of rebellion in a world that's making us feel not enough all the time. I'm doing this for me, for the first time ever. \\n\\nAny advice appreciated.

But if your deficit is not extreme, and if your diet provides sufficient protein for building, and sufficient energy to perform greater lifts for controlled strains, you will make gains and still have personal records (new highest lifts).   They won't come as often as those on a different journey in your gym (bulking -- the weightlifting version of walking downhill), but you will see some progress.

You may have proportionally low muscle mass (a high body fat percentage) but still a lot of muscle mass in and of itself.

But this is the main reason behind cut/bulk cycles. \\n\\n> I get told the argument of weightlifting increases your maintaince calories but its not by a earth shattering amount is it.\\n\\n* For people who have just been in a deficit for an extended period of time, taking a maintenance break will help reset things back to normal, if you are like many who end up with weirdly low calorie burn potential (ie. You're maintenance calories are super low compared to what they should be). Overall, increasing your muscle mass does increase your calorie burn because fundamentally, muscle burns more calories than fat. The amount of increase is different for everyone since body types and genetics play the main role in this)\\n\\nNow, many people here get told to work on weightlifting instead of eating at a deficit because\\n\\n* they're are already a healthy weight and unhappy with their body fat percentage.

This is why you lose weight.\\n\\nThe body first focuses the energy of calories to vital bodily functions. Muscle recovery / growth is secondary. This is why you lose muscle. If you go in a deficit for too long, your body more and more uses your calories for the vital functions and uses less for muscles. This is why people switch between bulking and cutting.\\xa0\\n\\nIf you want to lose weight consistanly, you should go for about -200 calories per day. Since you need to burn 7.500 calories for 1kg of fat, this will take quite a while. You can go higher but your muscle growth will ultimately be hindered by this.\\n\\nThis can to some degree be countered by Protein. Normally you should take in about 1g of Protei per 1kg of body mass (could be more not sure). Protein is manly used for cell and tissue recovery and therefore is not much used by your other organs.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n- Eating more calories than you need in a day is excess\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nAn excess is stored by the body as fat. This is why you gain weight.\\n\\nThe body uses the excess calories for \"bad times\" and stores it. The calories are also used for your vital bodily functions first. Since there is an excess the body can use more than normal for your muscle recovery and growth (bulking phase).\\n\\nHere you should also consume 1g Protein per 1kg of body mass.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nNormally your body should use about 2.4k - 2.5k calories a day. Best you use one of the online calculators to determine it more closely for you. This is for normal ppl.\\n\\nIf you are someone who sits in a pc the whole day and barely moves (like I did before) it is much lower though.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nFor weightlifting it`s hard to set an amount of calories you burn, since it differs a lot from exercise to exercise as well as the intensity you work out with.\\n\\nTo burn calories, doing cardio is much easier. One of the best ways I found was setting a tredmill at an incline of 14 and walking at a pace of 4km/h. This alone burns almost 800 calories per hour (and is good for your calves).\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nHope this helps',\n",
       " \"Disclaimer: I'm not a gym person, but I do plan to add muscle in my current maintenance phase and had some similar thoughts at some time. What I learned:\\n\\n>If I haven't trained I'm told weighlifting will keep the muscle I have if I keep my protein high, but if I haven't trained for years surely there's nothing to keep?\\n\\nEverybody has muscles. Even a 90 years old. With time, with decreasing activity, muscle mass goes down. Your TDEE goes down. Also, there are also nonskeletal muscles, like the heart, which you want to keep strong and healthy.\\n\\nA study from last year, by Herman Pontzer shows, that the metabolism speed remains constant between 20 years and 60 years of age if we take the muscle mass into account.\\n\\nIn other words, build the muscle mass of an average 20 years old and you will have the metabolism speed of an average 20 years old. Or get better. I'm in my 40s ... I give it a try, and see if I can look a little more like Mark Lewis (see youtube).\\n\\nThe proteins aka. amino-acids are the building blocks for cells. If you don't get enough proteins, your body can't repair and build new cells. Any cells, not only muscles. Your muscles/cells are actually being destroyed and rebuilt permanently, with some recycling of amino acids. This process needs new material and energy to run.\\n\\nThe WHO recommends around 0.4g of protein per pound of body weight. Most athletes (not only bodybuilders) see this als not sufficient for building muscle, as the there are many types of proteins, playing different roles, and also some of the protein is getting burned for energy or not available during the muscle growth phase (sleep). At least the higher protein requirement for muscle growth is validated by science.\\n\\nThis is why you will hear a higher recommendation for protein intake from athletes. Usually at least double than the WHO recommends, usually more. That is why many people take supplements. Which you probably don't need. Just enough protein.\\n\\nAlso, increasing the amount of protein we eat, helps, even without exercise, to maintain muscles. Not much, but for sedentary persons, relevant. \\n\\nFun fact: among the great apes, the humans are actually an exception, a chimp builds muscle from eating protein with little exercise, while humans tend to accumulate fat, to help them fuel that big brain at any time. Chimps are lazy, but muscular. Different evolutionary paths.\\n\\nRegarding supplements, creatine is something you will hear a lot. Is backed by science, but unless you get quite serious about weight lifting, extra creatine, will not bring very much. And, it will store water in your muscles (trust me, you have muscles) which means a significant jump in body weight. But makes the muscle look bigger.\\n\\n>Adding weight helps build muscle but if I am going to be in a long term calorie deficit I'm going to struggle to add weight when I reach certain point. Therefore I'm going to struggle to add much muscle if I'm not lifting heavier.\\n\\nNot sure I get the point correctly. You talk about cut and bulk cycle?\\n\\nYou don't need to bulk if you are overweight. Bulking is for bodybuilders with a single digit body fat percentage. \\n\\nYou only need to exercise. The food should give you enough energy (**carbs/glycogen**) for your exercise routine and be able to increase the weight you lift (progressive overload) BUT also provide the body with enough **proteins** to build muscles (see above).\\n\\nSome of the energy for lifting weight will come from the fat reserves. So you can actually build muscle on a calorie deficit. The problem is, that fat is slow in producing energy, so you also need the carbs (glycogen) to exercise. Don't go low-carb if you lift weights.\\n\\n>I get told the argument of weightlifting increases your maintaince calories but its not by a earth shattering amount is it.\\n\\nOne kg of muscles burns 3 to 5 times as many calories as the same quantity of fat tissus.\\n\\nBased on my BMR estimations using body fat (Katch-McArdle) if I replace 4 to 5 kg fat with muscles (possible for a beginner in about one year or less) I could increase my BMR by at least 100kcal. Because most activities burn a multiplicator of your BMR, the TDEE grows even higher. I hope for a TDEE increase with 150kcal (the current sedentary TDEE is about 1950). Thats' a lot, when on maintenance.\\n\\nThis is my plan for the next year.\\n\\nIs also, the **only possibility known** to increase your BMR. So ...\\n\\n>answers that aren't bro science\\n\\nI know what you mean, but sometimes, bro-science is just the results of observations people have made and best practices in the area of muscle and fitness. They may not always understand why something works, but if it does ...\\n\\nOf course, is hard to filter the good, relevant parts, without some experience. But don't discount everything.\",\n",

But later the hunger and desire for tasty foods come back and you need the biggest engine possible to give yourself some “free calories” to consume.\\nSome also hypothesise adding muscle makes you automatically more active and fidgety etc. Which you want.

Doing the couch to 5k routine. Any tips on decreasing recovery time? My thighs really start to hurt after the running. Will there be a point when my body becomes used to it and it becomes much easier and pain-less for me?Does CICO actually work or have I been misunderstanding it?\\n\\nI have been eating less than my TDEE for over a month, I haven’t really seen any changes or weight loss. I haven’t exactly done this on purpose just haven’t been eating enough because I wasn’t hungry enough to eat more. Plus dealing with uni exam stress.Geez. I was at a big work event yesterday, and professional photos have come in.\\n\\nI look dreadful, I feel like I look massive, and my face looks so puffy and gross, with resting bitch face to top it off.

I’ve been in a lazy plateau since we started getting into winter, and haven’t lost for a while.Ok I\\'ve been walking for 2 weeks now, and my feet are killing me. How do I get my feet from hurting so bad? I am 245lbs down from 248lbs and 5\\'2 female. My goal weight is 180lbs. I walk almost 3 miles a day. My husband says its normal. Can anyone give advice?how long should you be on a calorie deficit and should you increase intake for a while once you plateau?I currently have a Fitbit Inspire 2.

I’m thinking about getting an Apple Watch, but I was hoping to hear some feedback before dropping that kind of money. Pros and cons? Was it worth it?I just started losing weight a week ago. Is it normal to lose 5 lbs the first week? Is that actual fat or just water weight? Am I doing something wrong?I have Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFRID) & have a lot of trouble eating.

I noticed actually preparing the food also makes me gag. \\n\\nSo would anyone have any advice on how to lose weight with this? The food box delivery service has really healthy foods & it helps me a lot on being able to eat. I know for a fact though because I\\'m eating so little some days, my body is just holding onto fat and all that. I know I\\'ve lost some weight since this got to the point where I\\'m at now but I\\'m still very big. \\n\\nAny & all advice is welcomed.Does anyone have advice for switching to maintenance without gaining water weight? I\\'m considering overshooting my goal a bit based on the assumption my weight will shoot up from the extra sodium/carbs/waste.I feel like I can maintain good eating habits for 1 or 2 days, but then I fall into temptation and end up messing up what I\\'ve done so far... How do you resist to not eat things that you should\\'t and not spoil what has been done?I eat way too much if my house is full of food.

I have had 1 or 2 binge days when I got low on energy during workouts, and I haven\\'t had a low energy day in over a week so I think I made good adjustments.\\n\\nI also cut back drinking alcohol to maybe once a week, and I plan around drinking (hydration and meal-wise).

Before I had Covid (April) I lost 2 lbs / month every month -> now a good month is if I lose a pound. My body has started stalling with losing even thou I do still eat 1200 a day and its testing my patience real good... :/UPDATE: If your partner doesn\\'t want to lose weight is it right to respect that or is that enabling them?Previous post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/vl5ttz/if\\\\_your\\\\_partner\\\\_doesnt\\\\_want\\\\_to\\\\_lose\\\\_weight\\\\_is\\\\_it/?utm\\\\_source=share&utm\\\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/vl5ttz/if_your_partner_doesnt_want_to_lose_weight_is_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\\n\\n So from my last post people did seem to agree I am enabling my partner. I think that I am and have decided to stop getting her food, a lot of people suggested showing I care in other ways and that seems like a nice idea. She still doesn’t want to lose weight and will continue to order food (she does earn her own money and pay for this, a lot of people thought I was supporting her financially which just isn’t true). I also kept getting asked what capacity the scales were, they were 400lbs. \\n\\nI talked to her about this and she was upset at first but we kind of talked more about how I felt i’d caused her to gain more weight than she would have otherwise. We then had quite a long talk about that, she said after we first moved in together she was gaining weight fast enough to really notice it. Apparently I did always bring her a lot of food that she probably wouldn’t have got for herself, she said part of it was she’d always been quite embarrassed to get too much food for herself but that me giving it to her made her feel like it was ok. She didn’t blame me, she found it cute that I’d always bring her something. \\n\\nShe did also talk a little more about how the weight is causing her pain, she is also quite worried about how much harder she\\'s finding things. It was pretty clear she just wanted some support for that, so I’m not going to try and push it further. I do know it’ll get worse but I don’t really know what to do the help. I think this has been positive step for us, and hopefully she won’t gain much more weight without me giving her more food.Not to sound cruel, but if she\\'s already passed the 400lb mark and continues to gain (with her health/mobility issues starting already)  you have to ask yourself if you\\'re willing to go from *companion* to *caregiver*....I... Honestly do not know what I could say.\\n\\n>She still doesn’t want to lose weight and will continue to order food (she does earn her own money and pay for this, a lot of people thought I was supporting her financially which just isn’t true).\\n\\n>She did also talk a little more about how the weight is causing her pain, she is also quite worried about how much harder she\\'s finding things. \\n\\nTo me, this spells that she\\'s actually fully aware that the weight is a major problem, that it\\'s already hurting her physically, and that it will only get worse as she ages. But she\\'s also fully accepted it and is perfectly content with it; she\\'s picked her hill and is willing to die on it.\\n\\nAs others have said, ask yourself if you\\'re willing to go from partner to caregiver, because from the looks of it, this is going to get much worse before, if at all, it gets better. She\\'s very soon going to depend on you for many things, and might even lose the ability to do her job and be financially independent.Thats awesome glad you had a talk with her and it went well. That\\'s gotta be a relief. Now for the harder conversation: what\\'s the action plan, how are you guys gonna turn this ship around?Did you look at Al-Anon?  Or CODA?\\n\\nSeriously.  They’ll help you decide for yourself, in your own head, what are appropriate boundaries in your particular case.\\n\\nShe’s an addict, no question.  That part is down to her and up to her.  To figure out your part, you need real help, from people who are experienced with addiction and compassionate.  \\n\\nThe majority of experience here involves having the will, but the flesh is weak. If she doesn’t have the will… it’s awful but you can’t provide that for her second hand.\\n\\n A lot of people here care about you and will give as much advice as they have, but if it isn’t enough please check out some kind of group or at least sub for addicts.  Good luck, you seem like a really nice person.I also recommend therapy. \\n\\nAnd can you be the change you want to see? Like start going for walks? Ask her to come with you to the grocery, or just hang out at a park together? Good luck to you! And hers hoping for a long healthy and happy life for you two together!!!OP, I’m gonna be honest with you here: you didn’t cause her to gain weight and she likely would’ve got the food without you. I say this from a place of understanding because my partner and I eat differently. He has more flexibility with his food choices than I do, because we are two genetically different people. With that being said, we have had to have a really honest conversation about what we will buy and how we can work as a team to both achieve our fitness goals. Now we both eat more nutritious foods and some not so nutritious foods in more moderation.I don’t have any helpful advice to give. I just wanted to say you sound like a lovely, caring person and I hope you and your partner can work this out and restore her health.At some point in the near future, there\\'s going to come a time where you\\'ll have to turn into a caregiver for her instead of her partner. I\\'m so very sorry to be blunt and rude but you need to hear it. If you\\'re ready to take on that role mentally and emotionally, physically as well, you can let her continue like that.\\n\\nIf not, you guys need a plan to help her lose weight. You say she\\'ll continue ordering her own food because she has her own money. Sure, the money is hers but that doesn\\'t mean that she gets to risk her life and you turn into a caregiver for her. Not to mention the toll it\\'s going to take on your relationship and both of your mental and emotional health. She needs to take responsibility for herself. That\\'s as straight as it gets.\\n\\nYou don\\'t deserve a life where you turn into a caregiver for a young person when you\\'re so young yourself. It is harsh but it\\'s the truth. She\\'s crossed the 400 lbs mark and that in itself is huge. I crossed 220 lbs mark last year and I was so scared for myself. I started taking accountability for myself and Calorie counting, weight training and walking. The point is, there comes a time in everyone\\'s life where they have to start taking responsibility for themselves.\\n\\nThe time for your GF is now. She can spend all the money on food but she can try to make healthy choices. \\nYou talked to her, that\\'s good. But she still didn\\'t make any changes or even told you that she\\'d attempt to make them. You need to reflect on that. She does too. Have another talk with her. Make her see reason. And then maybe if she agrees, you can accompany her to make her feel supported and encouraged. Otherwise, you need to think hard and long about how you\\'re going to proceed.She’s made you complicit in her addiction that will very soon completely disable her and you’re ok with that. Not sure what else there is to say…I think most noteworthy opinions have been mentioned. Maybe one aspect did not stick out enough: be aware that drastic physical (and mental for that matter) abnormalities can lead to very ugly self enforcing downward spirals. \\n\\nAn example: a physical attribute that you love disappears, your partner notice how you look at them differently, body confidence takes a hit, more difficult to talk about the issue, ... And at the end you lose the ability to negotiate with each other even in unrelated questions.Remember that this could just be a step. She may be saying now that she\\'s not interested in losing weight, but she\\'s also saying she\\'s worried about pain and her health. It may be that after giving it more thought she\\'ll change her mind. Who knows, just by OP quiting giving her food, she may start to lose weight and it may encourage her.if you still have not even considered therapy i think thats your little way of admitting you know it has more to do with you than youre letting onHonestly, it’s very difficult to motivate someone who doesn’t want to change themselves. \\n\\nLead by example & live a healthy lifestyle. Invite them out for a walk everyday, have fun & create goals like hiking cool certain trails. Learn to cook at home instead of always ordering in! It’s more fun & you realize how many calories are in the foods you eat. \\n\\nUnfortunately fat-acceptance has become a thing. She needs to realize she’s putting your livelihood & hers in jeopardy. \\n\\nHope things turn for the better for you guys.Exactly how much weight has she gained since she’s been with you?\\nWas she always that big?It sounds like you have to figure out what is making her feel this way about herself. What I mean is, why is she expressing concern but not doing anything? And most people never look into this and educate themselves. On other people’s issues. \\n\\nSo if you want to be helpful, educate yourself on this. Learn negotiation skills. Learn the hormonal roadblocks of weight loss, the mood/mental health component too. This person probably feels helpless because they don’t know what to do, and they might have fear of failure involved. \\n\\nI recommend Jason Fung’s book “The Obesity Code”.  He boils it down to insulin and cortisol, fantastic writer.\\n\\nHe doesn’t talk about the dopamine connection…  which also is helpful to know about. A fact is that a stim drug used for aDHD is approved for binge eating disorder. Because people who binge often lack dopamine, and the food is what helps them boost it.\\n\\nEdit: I had to learn all of this for myself and still struggled. Never hit past 200 but it’s because I do things every year to lose at least 20 lbs that I gain over the winter months due to the mood changes dark days bring!I’m really glad that the two of you talked. \\n\\nI’m worried about her pain, too. I’m a chronic pain patient, so I’m going to take a brief detour to talk about pain. \\n\\n I just graduated from a pain management class where I learned a ton. Movement is *so important* for handling pain. But it feels counterintuitive, and instead people move less. And then they hurt more. It’s a spiral that traps people in their own homes. And when you’re trapped and in pain … it’s really, really easy to turn to food for comfort. \\n\\n100% unrelated to any weight loss, she may want to look into moving for pain management. Not join a gym or anything major, just whatever she can do. Even if it’s to the mailbox and back. Doing movements to help preserve range of motion in her joints. (A doctor’s help is very useful here, to help distinguish between pain that is information and pain that isn’t.)\\n\\nAlso look at TENS units for pain; the TENS 7000 is what my pain doctor recommended and it’s around $30 on Amazon. Super effective; has cut way down on my need for otc painkillers. \\n\\nDetour over. \\n\\nI’d strongly consider therapy, both individual and couple’s therapy. This is a big stressor for the relationship; it’s worth getting some professional support involved.\\n\\nI … look, I am not here to throw stones. I gained about 100 pounds and my spouse stopped being physically attracted to me. It killed all intimacy in the relationship for a long time. They didn’t want to hurt me by it, it was just true. But I wasn’t ready to face it, to do anything about it. We stayed together and are still together, though I certainly have emotional scars. Your desire to stay is a clear sign of love and support. \\n\\nBut I’m also the child of an alcoholic and an enabling parent. I don’t know if you two are thinking kid thoughts, but … be really, really thoughtful about bringing a kid into the situation, would you? You can make decisions about what you’re willing to stay through. But a kid can’t say enough is enough.\\n\\nWishing you both the best.You can\\'t stop her from ordering food. But whatever you do, OP, don\\'t start going to the door to get the food for her and bringing it to whatever room she\\'s in. If you start doing that, she\\'ll end up on \"My 600lb life\" in no time. Insist that she gets it herself. By all means cook her healthy meals and serve her small portions with at least 50% veggies. But never, ever enable her overeating again. \\n\\nThis is a really serious thing - it\\'s called morbidly obese for a reason. She could die.>Apparently I did always bring her a lot of food that she probably wouldn’t have got for herself, she said part of it was she’d always been quite embarrassed to get too much food for herself but that me giving it to her made her feel like it was ok. She didn’t blame me, she found it cute that I’d always bring her something. \\n\\nTBH this still reads like blame shifting to me. If you brought her too much food, it was totally possible for her to eat some of it and then save the rest for later. But since she ate it all, you thought that was the right portion to get and continued to give her large portions of food. I am also skeptical that she would not have gotten large portions of food for herself.Its good that she admitted that and you realized you do enable her, and u not getting her food is defo a step in the right direction...but her health is going to disintegrate fast... :/ try to include healthier habits with her and have healthy meals together, dont drink sodas at all imo at home for example. If she becomes so obese that she is no longer mobile, it\\'s going to be that much more difficult for her to get healthy. I wish you both all the best.You aren’t in charge of your partner - you are in charge of yourself and if their weight is a problem for you it’s ok to goTake MDMA togetherYou can\\'t make her lose but you can control your actions. It is so effing hard to say no to someone you love but you have to learn how. If you can\\'t then you truly are making it worse for her than she is making it herself. \\n\\nThe hard part I find is being positive. It is too easy to make no sound negative and unsupportive. Think about how to say no in a positive light. That will help. Get ahead of situations by promoting the positive choice. Have conversations with your partner to agree on positive ground rules like \"today, how about we aim for these calories? Is this something you are ready for?\" It makes it easier to say supportive things. Resist the urge to bring forward past bad behavior. If blame is placed on you, or you find yourself blaming your partner, try your best to reframe the discussion in the now. The past can hurt badly but that is not now. Having a successful future means making the right choices now so the past mistakes are less likely to be duplicated. \\n\\nI know this sounds hokey but my partner and I unintentionally enable each other and we have high stress situations. We had to learn the hard way to find good and healthy paths forward without overstepping bounds and not enabling each other. We are far from perfect but we make great decisions most of the time. It is easier to move forward knowing that we make good choices. It makes it easier to make good choices as a habit. \\n\\nDo not lose hope and do not give up on them or yourself. Every decision is a new opportunity to make things right.You’ve obviously identified the problem. You can’t force her to. This seems like a severe lifestyle change situation or you’re better off saving yourself the trouble and enduring a couple months of pain from the breakup to save you years if not decades of a never ending battle. \\n\\nI’d recommend therapy but it’s hard to convince someone they need to change their behavior if they’re not committed and don’t see the problem themselves. Best of luck.My tips for losing 22 lbs (loose CICO, not hating myself, paying attention to my emotions)Hi all!\\n\\nI\\'ve been wanting to post something like this for a while, but since I hadn\\'t lost all that much I didn\\'t think anyone would want to read it. Well, now I\\'m 10 kg (22 lbs) down (7 kg to go), and I think that qualifies me to post my advice, haha.\\n\\nI\\'ve lost the weight without really counting calories. I\\'ve had bursts of strict tracking but they never last longer than a couple of days, so now I\\'m just mostly playing it by ear as far as calories are concerned. I will sometimes (rarely) look at the packaging to see how many calories I\\'m consuming and I\\'ve remembered the calories for some of the things I eat often. I also did IF for a while, and while it was a great \"gateway\" into weightloss, I have continued to lose even when not paying attention to when I eat. These are some of the tips and tricks that have worked for me, and I would love to read yours.\\n\\n1. I\\'ve stopped denying myself things I like. If I want potato chips, I buy the smallest bag there is (50g), so that when it\\'s gone it\\'s gone and there\\'s no temptation left in my home. Yes, a big bag is cheaper per kilo than a small one, but that\\'s just my motivation to not indulge too often.\\n2. I try to eat more protein rich foods, since I\\'ve found that they fill me up for longer - an apple and a tbsp of peanut butter leaves me feeling full (and craving free) longer than a bowl of pasta. I would never eat an apple and pb instead of a full meal, but I have it often as a snack.\\n3. When eating a carb rich meal (rice, pasta, potatoes), I eat half as much of the carb as I would normally, and just add veggies, eg. where I would normally eat 2 cups of cooked rice, I\\'ll have just a cup and then a cup of, say, broccoli.\\n4. If I\\'m having bread, I make sure to cut a very thin slice, like half or a third of the normal slice for me, then I toast it so that it doesn\\'t fall apart, and also I love crunchy, toasted bread.\\n5. I\\'m not super strict with this, but I\\'ve learned to cook without oil or with just a tbsp or so for the whole meal (for two). Fats are important, though, but I\\'d rather get my daily portion from things that I enjoy eating - a piece of chocolate, some avocado, nuts...\\n6. If I\\'m craving something super high in calories, like a doughnut, a bigger bag of chips, a slice of cake, I eat it as a meal, not in addition to my three daily meals. Then, when (if) I get hungry later, I\\'ll have some fruit or veggies.\\n7. Most important: When I\\'m craving food but I\\'m not hungry, I\\'ll have a little talk with myself. Why do I want to eat this? Is it because I\\'m bored? Find something to do. Is it because I\\'m watching a movie and I need to keep my hands busy? Crochet something. Is it because I don\\'t want to work and eating is a good excuse not to? Just do a little bit of work or find something else to do. Is it because I\\'m sad/tired/in a bad mood and my usual reaction to this is to eat? What else would put me in a better mood? A bath, a nap, reading a book? Great, go do that. Sometimes it\\'s not that deep, I just want something because I want something and that\\'s fine too, but it pays to figure out the why of your cravings.\\n8. Second most important: It got easier once I convinced myself that I\\'m not a bad/lazy/unworthy person because I\\'m overweight. When losing weight became just something to do to make my life easier, once the emotional/self worth component was out, it somehow wasn\\'t that hard to just not eat as much.\\n9. I\\'ve stopped beating myself up for going over my calorie budget. A deficit is a deficit so as long as I\\'m under my TDEE most days, it\\'s all good.\\n\\nStay at it, I believe in you. We\\'ve got this!\\n\\nEDIT: It took me three months to lose the 10 kg.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Thank you for the silver!!!That was a really nice read.  I have been similar but slower, this time I just decided that I was doing it slow and steady and lost 20kg in about a year, not beating myself up but not stopping either.  I didn\\'t count calories at all but I stayed calorie-aware - very loose CICO indeed.  I think I was running only a tiny deficit but it still works and it makes me less hungry even than eating more.  There seems to be a sweet spot.This is a great set of tips - thank you for sharing. I think your point 7 is really important but also one I struggle with. I think I\\'m going to focus on that the next time I have cravings. Thanks!10kg in 3 months?! \\n\\nlove your tips btw! 100% agree and i try to practice most of what you say, except point 7. bored snacking is still a big problem for me. \\n\\non that note, is it REALLY okay to cook without oil? my parents are freaking out about how i’m going to burn the food (bc burnt food is carcinogenic) and make me use oil. i just got nagged at for buying an oil spray because it’s really pricey. oil has so much calories, i really want to cut it out!8 & 9 are really important. \\n\\nWhile being grounded in reality is important for motivation, going too far negative is also bad. \\n\\nI always used to blame my weight for all my problems. Difficulty finding a partner? It’s because I’m fat. Trouble at work? Fat. The guy at the store was mean to me? Fat. In hindsight, it’s clear to me now that this was my knee jerk answer for every problem. \\n\\nThen I lost all the weight. But somehow none of my problems got better… The realization that part of your world view has just been shattered is pretty jarring. I’m hindsight I wasted years of my life feeling bad about my body.Awesome, sustainable advice!The whole, but less carbs, bit more veggies thing is GREAT. Vegetables, especially ones lower in starch/carbs, have minerals and vitamins we need to live. Also fiber, not only heart healthy but keeps us full longer!You are my hero!! I’m going to refer back to your post often. I’m really upset today that the weight isn’t just ‘melting off of me’ (unrealistic expectations!!) and I am so happy to read your post! You’ve given me hope 😊This is amazing advice! I also have lost 20 pounds and I started off super strict and such and now that my toes are in the water.  I’m eating towards my goal weight maintain and just trying to make sure I stay balanced then anything.  Congrats on your weight loss!This is what I’ve started doing too! I hope I have the same success. I’ve been reeeeeally trying to take out the guilt/self-hatred and just view it as status quo. I love pasta, and threw in lots of veggies to balance it out.Same here! 10kg loss with calorie awareness as opposed to counting. I do a 30min HIIT session 5 mornings a week and walk once or twice a day with my toddler.What is your height and starting weight?I love #6! I don’t know why that hadn’t occurred to me before. Of course, I highly prefer more satiating meals, but in the event that I am really craving a sweet or snacky thing, I’m going to remember your post.I’m loving your #6! I may have to try that approach from time to time… sometimes you just have to indulge a craving!You know what’s so weird? When you end up eating more, and then lose more because you’re eating more. Eating more made me have more energy to work out, which resulted in me building muscle and losing fat. I was so scared I would regain the fat I lost doing that, but I’m so glad that I took the plunge and started eating more. (5”4 man, CW 150 pounds , went from 200 to 135, and then gradually gained muscle)These are good tips, especially the first one. I never deny myself a can of coke or something, because I know that although it is 60 calories, if it helps me keep my diet and my calorie deficit, it’s not that significant. Best to enjoy a coke every day or two than to go on some sugar spree and eat 3,000 calories of candy in a day alone (which isn’t even that much, a damn box of tictacs is 500 calories, and they’re 20g). As for tip 6, what I’ve had work best for me so far is to just brush my teeth or drink a shot of sugar free syrup or drink a large amount of water, they make me lose my sweet tooth very quickly. I’ll take these tips into account, the one about protein filling you up is quite insightful, what I do usually is just fill up on watermelon, that shits filling and since it’s mostly water it’s low in calories.I feel like I really needed to read this today. I\\'ve been feeling really lost with weight loss like I\\'m constantly fighting with food either restricting and counting every single morsel of food or just giving in and eating a lot of everything... I guess I\\'ve been feeling stuck, like I\\'m not able to lose weight no matter what I do but in truth I know that I stress/boredom eat and work a desk job for far too many hours in a day. So thank you for sharing your journey and letting me snap out of it a little bit. I\\'m going to try and take your adviceWhat is CICO that I always see on this sub?Unfortunately I’m not able to fully read right now but I am definitely saving for later. Thank you!!Tons of ways to do it, but seems like you found the way to manage your CICO.  I have used some of these strategies as well.  Especially #8 and #9.I just lost 40 lbs and I do exactly what you said in point 3 and point 5. I hit a plateau that lasted for more than a month but As soon as I started adding veggies I broke my plateau. I guess due to the added volume in my food I eat less. And if I get hungry late at night those veggies fill me up. Despite being low in calories lol.7 really put things in perspective for me! Thanks!i like this advice! i have lost 15 lb counting calories and now i’m trying to lose the last 5-10 without counting. like you, i feel like i can remember the calories for my most often eaten foods. thanks for the tips!I love this so much! Congrats to you. It sounds like a truly (mentally) healthy way to go about it.8 was the biggest for me. Once I started to consume calorie-less things when I was craving consumption, I started dropping pounds. La Croix, maybe a mini V8 because it doesn’t have much calories. At night you’re rarely hungry, more so just cravingI’m guessing you are male?Water weight , darn it!I\\'m the person who is always reminding everyone that it\\'s normal to fluctuate within a five pound range daily. Digestion and fluid retention can cause your weight to go up and down. If you gain 2 pounds overnight, it doesn\\'t mean you secretly at 7,000 extra calories, it just means your body is retaining fluid. \\n\\nThe wisdom for years was \"don\\'t weigh yourself too often\", but when I started a program that recommended daily weigh ins, thing actually clicked for me. I really saw and understand my body\\'s normal, daily ups and downs. I also saw that although my weight fluctuated daily, my overall trend was downward. My highest peaks were sloping down. It\\'s taken about two years, but I\\'m down about 45 pounds so far.\\n\\nHowever... \\n\\nYesterday I hit a new low weight, 198.4. Huzzah! I haven\\'t been able to exercise as much as I want to, because reasons, so it\\'s great to see that my eating plan is paying off all on its own.\\n\\n*However...*\\n\\nThis morning, for whatever reason, I\\'m back up to 202.2. Arg! Yes, I know, everything I said above, blah blah. But some days, it\\'s just discouraging. I didn\\'t eat anything extra heavy or salty, and I didn\\'t drink a bunch of extra water. I actually peed a lot! So I don\\'t know what magic fluid retention button I pushed, but I\\'m annoyed. Yes, a few weeks ago 202 was my exciting new low, and today it\\'s my discouraging high. I\\'ll get back to 198 again, but seriously, human body, WTF?\\n\\n(Not looking for advice, just wanted to whine.)I feel your pain and also wish to whine. For a week and a half I\\'ve been unable to break 185 and I know that it is totally stress related... But this is adding to my stress damn it!!! I went for an extra-long walk to try and calm down about it but I\\'m still pissed (and stressed!) Off to angrily lift weights now.Every time I see a new low number, I tell myself it\\'s just a sneak peek. It\\'s a temporary look at where I\\'ll be in a few days or a week. Every now and then, it sticks around, but when it usually bounces back up, at least I don\\'t feel bad.Uh same, and it totally makes me feel like a phony when I remind people to just wait it out because it also totally impacts my mood. I just put the scale away for an extra week between weigh ins.I totally get it. I \"gained 4 lbs\" today after being at the gym the last two days and I know it\\'s just water weight but it was still disheartening.Eh, I’m giving advice anyway 😜\\n\\nI also weigh daily because most of the time seeing the curve is helpful. But when I hit a new low weight, not every time but if it’s an exciting one for me, I take 2-3 days off from weighing.  Usually I’ll also be really good on my diet to “make sure” it won’t be higher in 3 days.I can totally relate and am here to commiserate! It’s so frustrating to know something logically but you just want to see that number declining. \\n\\nI weighed 156.6 on June 2nd and felt so victorious! Then I had the most atrocious menstrual cycle rife with prolonged intense cramping, the most outrageous appetite, extreme fatigue and ultimately started a week late so I shot back up to 160lbs and spent the entire month of June trying to claw my way back down to where I was and this morning I finally weighed 155.8–but up until today I felt so discouraged like I had somehow not made any progress whatsoever for the entire month despite sticking to my deficit and daily walks. \\n\\nIt’s so hard to make peace with your body sometimes, but this month served as a lesson for me.I am feeling the same way. I have to weight myself everyday(and report to my nutritionist for a period of time ) and very often it impacts me and my mood, when I wake up and don’t see it going down I feel ok but when it goes up even rationally knowing other factors play a role I can’t help but feel kinda sad.. some times I even use some diuretic medication just to make sure it is water ( even knowing i shouldn’t be doing it )..Damn you water mystery weight battles! \\n\\nHappy scale app keeps me marginally sane when this happens as my ‘average weight’ is less depressing that the actual ‘mystery higher water weight or mystery higher didn’t poop enough rate’ that I see on my scalesI totally feel this. I have been stuck at 209 forever. I finally went down to 206.2…hallelujah! Then back up to 209.6 overnight.🥴🥴Yep def relatable. Had a 6 lbs increase because of period + stress. But knowing that I’m tracking my calories and not going over made me not get so flustered over it as I would have in my previous diet attempts! It’s helpful to take a break from weighing for 2-3 days like another commentor said.I’m holding 9-10 lbs of fluid right now. Started when I was pregnant, when my kidneys were going bad, and it continues, 3+ months after birthing.\\n\\nI hate having basically two wardrobes! I can’t really plan outfits ahead. Water weight isn’t fun. It’s not fun to watch the scale go back and forth.Me too. I know fluctuation and so on and so on, I use other methods to track my weight/body and don\\'t usually sweat the small stuff etc.\\n\\nBut man does it suuccck to go back up! I was up 100g this morning and i know it shouldn\\'t affect me and I\\'m usually able to shrug and know I\\'m still on track but that was a boot kick to both shins today. :(This is my life now, I’m fluctuating between 197.7 and 193.5 lb n it’s was driving me crazy… Then I remember I was also fluctuating from 202-197, the only reason I’m giving myself is that my body is looking for a new equilibrium so maybe my new normal will be 193.5 lb.Has anyone ever had a 20lb difference within a month?So relatable. I think we all (or most know) that this happens a lot, but it\\'s annoying and frustrating as heck. Going to join the rant. I\\'m sooo close to hit the next benchmark (finally want to see the 70\\'s again (kg), but no. Got my period and weight went up again. Will probably take two or three more weeks to get there. But as the saying goes it is what it is and just keep swimming...When I begun my journey I was completely unaware of my weight fluctuating as much as up to a 5 pound range. \\nI weighed myself and saw I was 4 pounds up and man I grew sad. It felt like I was losing. Three days later I saw I had suddenly dropped those 4 pounds. \\nGOTTA LOVE THAT WATER WEIGHT. My strength trainer buddy always gave me the best advice. She said, “weigh yourself once a week on a Wednesday. That way if you had a cheat day, your body will be most back to normal by the middle of the week because you’ll be back to routine.”\\n\\nBut if I start obsessing over a number, I make the hubby hide the scale.You’ve lost so much weight already, congrats ! By weighing daily you have so much information to look at, and it’s interesting to see what our bodies do week to week.  Keep moving forward 💕>(Not looking for advice, just wanted to whine.)\\n\\nJust to have more to wine about, you will get some unwanted advice!\\n\\n>So I don\\'t know what magic fluid retention button I pushed, but I\\'m annoyed. \\n\\nI know three of them: glycogen, gut water and sodium.\\n\\nA jump like that could be glycogen.  Your exercise level went down, your glycogen reserves got fuller, and 1g glycogen bind 3g of water. So .... having 150g more of glycogen => 600g or around 1.5 pounds. \\n\\nOr you had a well-deserved \"below 200\" celebration meal. and your body is pushing water into the small intestine to help with digestion. You get thirsty and retain some of the water.\\n\\nOr the spooky sodium. \\n\\nOn days like that, I channel the anger and go for a run to burn some glycogen ... It helps. \\n\\n>Water weight , darn it!\\n\\nCongratulation for going below 200lbs and the 45 pounds you lost already!Two years later, and I\\'ve done it!

When I\\'d posted two years ago, I was immensely depressed, frustrated and at my lowest point.  \\n   \\nIf you don\\'t feel like peeping my post history, I\\'ll give a rundown:\\n\\nAt around age twelve, I was prescribed antipsychotic medications for a condition I ended up not even having. This isn\\'t a psych subreddit, so I won\\'t delve into that agonizing ordeal, but it turns out that my problem required therapy, NOT medication, and certainly not something so intense as an anti-psych.   \\nFive years of abilify (with two of those being by injection, too!) later, and a complete overhaul of my diet, my body was ruined. I weighed over 120 pounds over the ideal weight for my height.   \\nI went from eating literal garbage as a teenager, to starving myself in my early twenties, to eating consistently clean for a year, at pristine, weighed CICO.  \\n\\nI began to work out despite feeling exhausted. Why wouldn\\'t the scale move?\\n\\n I was eating at a healthy deficit, why wasn\\'t I seeing a decline? \\n\\nSure, fluctuations happened, but after a meal, no matter how low-density or accurately weighed and measured, I\\'d climb several pounds over two days, only drop down once i\\'d beaten my appetite into submission and rest at an absolutely unsustainable caloric intake.   \\nAt my worst, I was taking in 600 calories a day,  with a side of self loathing. \\n\\n  \\n I was a burnt match;  I wanted to scream into the void but was worried that people would accuse me of lying or not \\'actually\\' eating in deficit a\\'la many posts around r/loseit in the same vein as the one i\\'d  written before.\\n\\n I made the decision to log off of online weight loss resources and book an appointment with a new doctor and explain my problem.  \\nI lucked out; the most incredible doctor i\\'d had the pleasure of meeting with saw me that same month.  \\n\\nHe was personable, empathetic and had experience with this sort of thing a handful of times, a few patients ago. We met with the intent to discuss weight loss as it\\'s done by the books.   \\nSurely, I was doing something wrong?  \\nAs soon as I mentioned why my weight began to climb, his face dropped.  \\n\\nHe asked if I was constantly fatigued, I said yes. He asked about my final dosage of abilifiy, discussed my initial misdiagnosis. He looked at my calorie tracker and just shook his head. He ordered labs. \\n\\nAfter collecting labs and realizing that evidently, I was not sustaining myself on Mcdonald\\'s and fried Oreos, he decided to set me on track to get a gastric bypass. \\n\\n  \\n With his referral, I made an appointment with a bariatric center a state over and got the ball rolling. It took six months. Continuous appointments With the guidance of healthcare professionals in remote-limbo talking me through nutrition education resources, I had my weight analyzed like coordinates to some nebulous mystery; as if it were a problem willpower couldn\\'t break.  \\n\\n  \\nA little under a year ago, I  got the procedure. It hasn\\'t been easy. Even with therapy, it was hard to shake the feeling that I took the easy way out.  \\n\\nI worked hard. I am working hard. I tried my best, and it paid off; I\\'ve lost 80 lbs— I\\'m about 20 lbs away from my goal weight. \\n\\nI am fit. I have some loose skin, but it\\'s a reminder that i\\'m fucking doing it. Even if I needed medical help to begin; I tear it up at the gym, I stick with my diet, and I never, ever gave up and ate the tub of gelato.  I\\'m losing a consistent 1-2 lbs and eating an appropriate amount for my GW.   \\nSometimes you just can\\'t do it alone.   \\nBy all means, start with CICO. I just want to remind everyone that CICO isn\\'t always a one-size-fits-all solution; especially when your body chemistry and hormones have been destroyed by an improper diagnosis and medication that\\'s now a thorny nest of class-actions and complaints regarding long-term weight loss problems.   \\n\\n\\nI apologize for how long this was, I hope it wasn\\'t a slog, and I hope I can help anyone in a similar boat. I wanna add that this isn\\'t to say CICO is bad or ineffective; sometimes you gotta dig a little deeper and get a Medical professional\\'s opinion. You just might have been fucked over by big pharma, or something!> A little under a year ago, I got the procedure. It hasn\\'t been easy. Even with therapy, it was hard to shake the feeling that I took the easy way out.\\n\\nTo me you went the extremely difficult route. For a lot of folks, CICO works, but in your case it couldn\\'t because of the medications you used to take. Absolutely no fault of your own, as I\\'m sure you know. You had to go about it in a very different way and undergoing a gastric bypass surgery is no small thing.\\n\\nA very well earned congratulations on losing 80lbs and I\\'m so happy for you that you were able to get the help you needed!Good health is so utterly taken for granted until we don\\'t have it anymore. Then it becomes priceless.\\n\\nI\\'ve had a similar bad experience with a GP who kept misdiagnosing my condition rather than making a referral as should have been done. Three years later, I wouldn\\'t go to the doctor anymore, but was convinced to go to (and was taken to) an optician\\'s. Lucked out on the optometrist I got that day, who became really concerned during the appt but was able to correctly diagnose and refer me on to the specialist for treatment.\\n\\nThe other thing that has really stood out to me was an interview with Terry Wahl where the descriptions of poorly managed autoimmune disease mirrored so closely to what I\\'d suffered through. I\\'d never heard of anyone having those experiences too. It gave me hope that there was a way to manage my condition so I could live a better quality of life.\\n\\nIt\\'s really painful to talk about these things. Those who have been blessed with good health have no real idea what it can be like on the other side. Getting surgery was not a cop-out. It\\'s not the easy way out in the slightest, it\\'s a big decision to make. You decided it was what was right for you and that\\'s the main thing. You\\'ve got to do what\\'s right for you.There’s no possible way that you were eating 600 calories a day and not losing any weight. The reason that people lose weight with bariatric surgery is that it forces you to take in fewer calories so that your body uses fat stores for its energy.Well done for losing all those weight!\\n\\nThere is no such thing as an “easy way out” when it comes to health. If your doctor and all those medical professionals think it’s necessary, it’s necessary.\\n\\nPlease don’t listen to some people on r/loseit who doubt your diet. I believe you were correct when you were only on a 600 calorie diet, your doctor’s and the rest of the medical team’s action proves that something was wrong, something that CICO cannot fix.\\n\\nWish you all the best in maintaining your GW.NSV!!NSV!!!\\nI (51f) have a non-scale victory to celebrate!!! (5’4”, SW: 222, CW: 187, GW: 135)\\nI’ve been a SCUBA diver for close to 30years. I’ve also had 9 knee surgeries. \\nI haven’t been able to get myself up the swim steps to the boat after a dive with my gear on for 15 years or so. I’ve needed help with someone taking the gear from me before I can come up the ladder. \\nIn the distant past I’ve been able to do it all on my own.\\nAfter losing 35 lbs and doing sooooo many squats during my VR workouts, I finally did it on my own again. After 15 years of having help I can do it my own!!!!!\\nI am so excited about this because it’s hard to explain to people that haven’t experienced it. I’m independent. I’m free!  \\nI’m still not at my ultimate goal and have a long way to go, but I see and feel the difference. I’m so happy to have finally made a change! Weight loss alone would have helped, but the exercise sent me over the top. \\nI’m more motivated to keep going than ever before!!!!\\n\\nNot doing the exercise this week due to vacation, but I’ll be back next week stronger than ever!\\n\\nPS… I’m using Supernatural on VR.wow. this is amazing. regaining functionality is the biggest win ever. congratulations!!!Wow. What an accomplishment! Congrats! Squats are killer for me but they are so important for lower body strength! This is such a significant change because you could have lost the weight and still not have the strength but you are doing both! Kudos to you and may your journey continue to be this amazing!Congrats to you! Amazing job! I can’t wait to see what you can do with the rest of the weight loss too :)🥳🥳🥳 go you!!! The best victories are often off scale\\nThank you for posting!

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/loseit) if you have any questions or concerns.*Here I am : I reached my goal weight !I’ve been excited about making this post ever since I saw the scale closing up on that number ! \\n\\nI started at 74kg/163lbs in February, 2 months to the day after welcoming my daughter. I set my goal at 63kg/139lbs which was my weight before the pregnancy. So it took me about 5 months to get there.\\n\\nFunnily enough, it seems that I didn’t quite realize I was actually going to make it to my objective before I was almost there. This probably taught me something in hindsight, about progress and how the tiny steps along the way proved a more tangible source of motivation to keep me going than my end goal, that was realistic yet seemed out of reach for a long time.\\n\\nI aimed at 1600 to 1800 calories a day with a classic balanced diet, never falling below as I’m also breastfeeding. However after losing about half the desired weight very fast, I hit a plateau and stagnated there for about 2 months. At that point I switched to low-carb and was able to resume weight loss until now.\\n\\nI wasn’t able to exercise much at the beginning as I had first to complete pelvic floor reeducation. Though I tried and went for a long walk everyday with the baby in a carrier and, when my oldest was out of school, volunteered at every occasion to get moving with him, playing ball and such. Seriously kids are like mini-athletes : great way to work out while having fun ! I later built-in a 20 to 30min, no-impact HIIT session 4x a week, at home. So far I’ve been pretty consistent at doing it and the variety of exercises keeps me from getting bored.\\n\\nNow that I’m where I wanted to be, I feel pretty good in my new habits. So I decided to keep going and set myself a new goal of 58kg/127lbs. I’m looking forward to see how that goes as I haven’t been that thin since before I had my kids AND I was vegan at the time.\\n\\nI also want to focus more on the fitness aspect from now, as my activity levels have been slowly decreasing over the years and just getting back to moving myself has felt super good already.\\n\\nAnyway I’m pumped for that new challenge ! I wish you guys all the best and of course lots of self-love and care along the way.Congratulations!!! This is the post that everyone dreams of being able to make! I am so proud of you and I hope it feels as good as I imagine it does. Congrats on your new goal too, I love that you’re giving yourself that goal so you stay even more successful. Good luck on your new one and congrats on your health!Congrats!  You have to feel wonderful!heck yessss!!!!Yay we’re on about the same timeline! I had my daughter 4.5mo ago, reached my prepregnancy weight of 150lbs maybe a month ago, reached my next goal of 140lbs about a week ago and now I’m aiming my sights at 130lb! 5’5” for reference. Congratulations on both your baby and success!This is so great, well done. I\\'m envisioning myself in your position one day able to say I\\'ve reached my goal. 30lb to go. Hopefully by Christmas I will be there :)Wow!!! So so inspiring. Congratulations!!\\n\\nI’m also a mom of 2 and I love seeing post partum weight loss stories! I’ve recently joined a gym that has a moms class where kids are welcome and it’s been a game changer for my fitness! It’s so fun to set fitness goals and reach them, you’re already obviously super strong from being a mom but lifting heavy things and pushing yourself will probably feel amazing!LETS GO!So proud!!!Another Doctor told me to Lose itI had another opportunity for a Doctor to tell me I needed to lose weight again today.\\n\\nI have lower back pain with some nerve impingement. Going through the list of options, he concluded with \"and of course you should shed any excess weight because it will only compound issues over time.\"\\n\\nI just get miserable, because it\\'s difficult to lose weight, especially during peri/menopause. \\n\\nI am down 16 pounds since I first saw this doctor back in March of this year, so the scale is moving. I just wish that doctors had better answers to HOW to lose it when they throw that around like it\\'s the answer to all ills.Wow! 16 lbs since March is great! That\\'s a steady loss of about a pound per week. Sometimes the biggest weight loss problem is unrealistic expectations. \\n\\nThere is no \"right¿ or \"best\" way to lose weight. You have to experiment until you find something that works for you. If doctors could give you *the* answer, I\\'n sure they would, but honestly, it just doesn\\'t exist.I mean in his defense he isn\\'t a nutritionist he\\'s a doctor. If you were coming to him for spine issues then he is correct that losing excess weight is going to provide significant relief to that specific problem.\\n\\nIt sounds like he gave you alternatives as well. Did you ask the doctor after he mentioned weight loss any questions about what you could work on? If so I\\'d hope he referred you to a nutritionist or something but I kinda doubt he was like\"idk not my problem\"16 pounds since March is great!!! I am down 40 and it\\'s taken a lot longer than I wanted, but I\\'m still better off than if I hadn\\'t tried or gave up. You\\'ll get there because you\\'ve already been making progress. Try not to be discouraged. You naturally will be sometimes, but push through and don\\'t give up.r/cico\\n\\nIt’s a slow but steady process, don’t expect quick results but it does workCould ask for a referral to a weight loss specialist. If it\\'s something you struggle with, that\\'s something to bring up with him.The process of losing weight is quite simple.\\n\\nIn practice, it’s tiring, unpleasant and downright hard.\\n\\nIt’s totally worth it though, and 16 lbs is great progress! Keep it up 😄😄If you want advice for methods on how to lose weight effectively, you\\'re in the right subreddit for one and two maybe go to a nutritionist since that\\'s their expertise. It\\'s good that you lost 16 pounds so clearly you\\'re doing something right.you are awesome!!! slow and steady wins the race, not all good doctors have good bed side mannersMaking ProgressI\\'ve been 200+ lbs since august. I just weighed myself (after eating dinner - I know it\\'s not very accurate, but I just wanted to see.) I was 198.6 lbs - which was what I was last April. Obviously this isn\\'t huge, but after a day\\'s worth of meals, I managed to be below 200, which makes me feel like I\\'m going in the right direction. I finally feel hopeful about my weight loss, which isn\\'t something I could\\'ve said at the beginning of my journey.Glad you’re feeling hopeful!! Nice work, keep it up!! 👏🥳NSV - new shirt fit me!I bought a new protein powder online recently and they send a shirt along with it for first time orders. I ordered a shirt that was a size smaller than my usual as a goal to strive for. After two and a half months of progress I tried on my shirt, a little skeptical about how it would look at first, but it looked so nice and it even had some room in there on the sides! It\\'s so nice to not feel like I had to be poured into my shirts anymore! One of the things I\\'m so self conscious about is my belly. Fitting well in the next size down is such a great feeling.\\nThank you for posting!

I’ve started taking supplements like creatine, multivitamin, whey protein and omega-3.\\n\\nLast year I’ve started boxing as well but to be honest, I can achieve much better of myself if I fix my diet even more.\\n\\nI used to visit McDonald’s drive thru after my work shift almost on daily basis and did let go of myself. Now, I’m truly dedicated to see my improved variant and all I can say it that you can do it too!\\n\\nIt doesn’t matter if you’re overweight. Dedication and willpower is what it takes to reach your goal and mine is far from where I am right now.\\n\\nCheers.Really great 👍 I love progress pics. It shows what we really are capable of.I\\'m curious, how much weight did you lose between the two pictures?Inspiring!!Dude tattoos are such a low key great way to stay motivated.

Dedication is what really counts, no matter where the starting line is. That consistency is what makes it happen. You\\'re killing it!You look very handsome, congratulations!You look awesome! Seeing the comments it looks like you did a body recomp, that’s what I’m trying to do. Body goals!Great progress! I have recently started my journey. It’s not easy but I feel excited every day to know I am making good changes for me. I saw Someone said something about how much you lost. It’s not about that, it’s about the changes to our bodies. You can lose a little on a scale and have lost many pounds of fat which were replaced with muscle and weight more than fat. Amazing the human body!!Willpower to me is so difficult! Once you start eating it’s almost impossible (in my experience) to stop. \\n\\nEven so, I’m very glad for you! May we all reach our goals\\n\\nEDIT: changed out to ourOHHHH HELL YEAH!!!!!!! Great job!!!!!!!!Well doneGood shit man if you like boxing you’ll love some jiu iitsu get after it brotha!!Wow you look amazing & I love your tattoos 🙂 good job!😍Amazing! I am 1.5 years into my weightloss and lifestyle change.  Last year I started training Krav Maga and have recently added boxing too!I like the word, \"improved variant\"What sorta program did you do to lose the weight?? Great job by the way bro!! Congratulations!!!How many calories were you consuming? Looking greatI don’t want to be that guys but don’t see any differenceReduced my daily deficit from 1500 to 1250 and gained weight!?M31. SW: 118.1kg / CW 106.8kg. \\n\\nI\\'ve been on a 1,500 daily calorie deficit for 8 weeks and managed to lose 11.5kg / 25lbs. On Monday I decided to change my daily calorie deficit from 1,500 to 1,250 and my weight loss has completely flatlined this week. I made this change because I no longer found the 1,500 deficit to be sustainable. I\\'ve gained 0.3kg this week despite eating clean and doing daily exercise. Can anyone shed some light on whats going on here? \\n\\nThe only thing I can think of is maybe my body is re-adjusting to the new calorie deficit? Im not sure how water retention would play into this either, as I havent been consuming an unusual amount of salt this week.\\n\\nIn terms of the extra 250 calories per day, I\\'ve added healthy calories. For example a small slice of organic protein bread, a healthy nut bar, maybe some 10g of butter in my cooking or a bit of extra cheese. It hasnt been any unhealthy or bad foods.How’s your sleep and stress issues? Because these are important to weight loss. And your hormones? Have you had bloodwork done to make sure there’s no hormone or medical issues? \\n\\n1250 is under-eating for your weight. So there’s probably other issues going on that’s causing you to not lose the weight. \\n\\n(And there’s really no ‘bad’ food, just too much food. And make sure you’re counting all the calories, dressings, sauces, oils and fats.)one week is nothing in long term - you can seem to plateu due to water etc for longer, even if you don\\'t think you changed much in terms of hydration/daily activity many other factors, weather conditions, hormones and so on can make your body decide to store even extra 1-2kg of water in short term and drop it later, its long term trend that matters\\n\\nas long as you are below TDEE even like 200 kcal deficit that \"weight gain\" on scale is not real or fat or whatever, its just fluctuation dont let it get to you, my excel shows I was at 85.0 - 85.3 since last friday and now last two days I am 84.6 84.4, I didn\\'t burn that over span of last 48 hours, it was just progress hidden under fluctuations>I made this change because I no longer found the 1,500 deficit to be sustainable. I\\'ve gained 0.3kg this week despite eating clean and doing daily exercise. Can anyone shed some light on whats going on here?\\n\\nProbably just water weight and a normal body fluctuation. Is hard to forecast/explain them I\\'ll wait for at least one more week. \\n\\nJudging the progress in the short term (per week) is stressful. On average, I had a cycle of 5 ot 7 days in my body weight fluctuation. Meaning, that every 5 to 7 days, I would hit a new lowest weight. Then my weight will go up slowly, and down again.\\n\\nOver a couple of months, I also had a couple of longer cycles of 10 to 12 days, with no change to my diet. But the average over the month stayed the same.\\n\\nWater retention is not only sodium but also glycogen and gut water. Eat something with more fiber, and your body will pump even more water in the small intestine ...\\n\\nI\\'ll wait a little more ... or ... do some cardio, burn some glycogen, release the water ...Remember it’s also possible to overeat ‘healthy food’. Calories matter. You’ll feel a heap better choosing nutritious food but an overall calorie deficit is the most important thing.Unless there is an arbitrary time sensitive goal I am personally against long term calorie counting.  For me it has led to repeated failures, yo-yo dieting & the sorts. I\\'ve learned to listen to my body, eliminate many bad habits (night snacking) and improve on others (binge on fruit vs cookies) that still allow me not feel care-free while continuing along my path. I don\\'t obsess on a scale anymore but do keep track. Ohh, and I LOVE exercise which is the key. Find something that works. Heavy weights and hiking in the woods for me. \\n\\nBut to each their own, find your lane and best of luck to you!Finally dropped below 40% bodyfat + gained insane muscle in a month?God knows I’ve been grinding and cutting for the past few months. This month, since I moved back home to take care of a family issue, I’ve been taking the cut very seriously. \\n\\nI have a free monthly inbody test at my gym, so I went this time for my routine body comp check and was dumbfounded. One of the boys was in disbelief and we asked them to recalibrate the machine twice and the same result showed. I lost 24 lb of bodyfat and gained 10lb of muscle in 37 days and am now 39.2% bodyfat. The thing is I’ve noticed one hell of a difference in my strength and body but I was like “the scale isn’t going down, so it’s all in my head.” I got a run down about anabolics use by the staff too so that was fun. I am completely natural and I don’t think this is normal but I’m glad and appreciate the victory anyway\\n\\nPhoto: https://imgur.com/a/N1hims1It\\'s possible the initial reading wasn\\'t calibrated right.Fantastic!! \\n\\nAs someone who uses InBody scans a lot, I’ve noticed that I need to be REALY well hydrated for accurate results. \\n\\nOne day I took them very dehydrated, then took another the next day well hydrated. The difference was a much lower fat % and a much higher muscle mass when I’m hydrated. Always make sure you are when taking them.My journey begins. A series of extremely painful gallbladder attacks over 10 days sent me to the hospital. Please don\\'t let it go this far until you start focusing on your health.The gall bladder attacks has been a real wake-up call. It scared me straight. The most pain I\\'ve ever been in. Inflamed gall-bladder, gall stones and fatty liver disease was the outcome of over a decade of not taking care of myself. Shit finally caught up to me. I\\'m 38 now and no longer have that \"youth invincibility\" going. \\n\\nIt\\'s been 2 weeks now and I\\'ve drastically changed my diet since I got out of the hospital. I might have to remove my gallbladder at a later date, but I\\'m going to try to heal it with a change in diet and lifestyle. \\n\\nI just wrote this post to try to warn others. Please don\\'t just lurk here like I\\'ve done for years. Actually start taking care of yourself. Don\\'t be like me and let it go this far. I\\'m lucky though that everything is healing now, it doesn\\'t seem like I have done irreversible damage to my liver, as each week my blood work shows major improvements.\\'\\n\\nStay healthy!Our bodies can take a lot of stress from our unhealthy lifestyles and it can fuel the feeling of \\'oh i\\'m really fat but i\\'m still healthy, another extra burger won\\'t do too much damage to me\\'. We put off taking care of our bodies because they seem to be functioning just fine.\\n\\nBut the truth is the accumulated stress on organs and the whole body will eventually reach a point where it will no longer be able to keep up and will start breaking down, sometimes really fast.\\n\\nMost overweight ppl get increasingly more alarming wake up calls and if we don\\'t acknowledge them and start making a change, our body will shut down.\\n\\nI\\'m glad you\\'re making a change and i hope you\\'ll be successful on your journey towards healthy lifestyle.I can\\'t stress this enough:\\n\\nGet the gallbladder out as soon as you can!!!\\n\\nI didn\\'t and it almost killed me\\n\\nI also got gall stones since I lost weight too quickly and the Doctor told me I should decide myself if they should remove my gallbladder. I was too afraid of surgery and also had a lot on my mind so I decided to wait. While I had attacks which send me to the flood crying I prefered this to surgery however one night it didn\\'t work anymore and I just woke up in pain and decided to go to the hospital - inflamed gallbladder a night later a gallstone decided to leave the gallbladder (I don\\'t know hoe to articulate this in English sorry) and blocked the pancreas so the stomach acids couldn\\'t get to the stomach. Long story short: I got a very bad case of pancreatitis and had only 5% chance of survival (since I was young, slim and kind of fit I guess the chances where a bit higher) and now I have to take care of what I eat for the rest of my life and can\\'t ever drink alcohol again.I’m very proud of you that you have decided to make a change, not many people I know would do that.\\n\\nFor me, the biggest factor that contributes to my weight loss is beginning to adopt healthy eating and exercise habits, a diet that sticks so I won’t relapse.\\n\\nI hope by sharing my experience, you can benefit from it as well.\\n\\nAll the best, and I hope you’re doing well.Glad you\\'re in the right direction and on the mend. But exactly how bad was this decade? What did you eat drink or smoke to get this bad? If you don\\'t mind me askingI got my gall bladder out in 2015 and lost 150 lbs from the lifestyle changes I made!My sincerest sympathies. I had a gallstone once (probably have loads still down there) and had three gallbladder attacks trying to pass it. Those were 30 minutes of the purest agony I have ever experienced in my life. And some people have them for *hours*.Good for you for committing to making the positive changes that will lead to a long and healthy life!! In 6 months, a year, 2 years, 10 years…. You will look back on this and thank yourself for making your health a priority. You can absolutely do this!!! Can’t wait to see your progress!!!Wait, gallbladder removal is caused by bad diet? I recently had my gallbladder removed for gallstones, and nobody ever told me that.Mine had to come out and I wasn\\'t in that bad of shape. It was purely a high cholesterol diet and high stress. Not having one does make me reconsider every food choice since there is no stored bile to break down a fatty meal.You’ll probably need it out soon if you’re having attacks that severe. It’s genetic in my family, regardless of weight. My attacks started getting more severe and more frequent until I ended up needing emergency surgery to get it outThat sounds awful!! I went to the ER for extreme stomach or gallbladder pain this past weekend. Never ever had pain this bad, stabbing feeling, I legit thought I was going to die. Was so sure it was gallstones because of experiences I\\'ve heard from others. Turns out it is bad acid reflux and I\\'ve gotta get that treated which losing weight would help enormously. It was a scary experience and I\\'ve been eating better for now, hopefully will keep it up.I had mine out 7 years ago. I was 10 stone at the time. It caused me horrendous pain. I had gallstones and an infection and was in hospital for a whole week. I still get attacks now. Mainly due to fizzy alcohol. \\nI have put so much weight on since I had it removed. I\\'m now 13st. \\nI do find peppermint tea is my saviour as it acts so quickly xDoes it hurt? Getting them out?I finally forced myself to startI\\'ve always had problems with eating, its my comfort of some sort when I feel anxious, I just eat. A lot.\\n\\nAt 115kg with 178cm height or 5\\'11\\', I just had my first shot at a workout, it was rather short but It was enough for me to not be able to get up from the floor.\\n\\nDo you guys have any advice about how to get sourself going on a diet if you have no time for prepping food? \\n\\nJust wanted to share lolHonestly, I\\'m losing weight while still eating a lot of pre-packaged foods, stuff that can be made with boiling water or in the microwave, frozen dinners and what I can get delivered via Doordash.  Is it as healthy as eating meals comprised of fully prepared at home fresh ingredients?  No, of course not.  Is it better than eating 3000 calories of fast food and sweets a day and nothing else?  Absolutely.Good shit!\\nHonestly, food prep is essential for long term success. Diet is more important than exercise for weight loss, and a huge part of that (for me at least), is food prep.\\n\\nThe easiest time to give in and eat shit food is when you are hungry AF and there\\'s nothing prepared in the fridge.\\n\\nTasty exciting food takes way longer to prep than boring bland food. For me, I need to forget about tasty exciting food for at least 5 days a week. It sucks, sure, but it makes life easier when trying to drop those lbs. I enjoy the shit out of my Friday evening cheat meal though and I load up on it.  This is what works for me, and I feel like a lot of people may not be able to deal with the boring food like I can though, my SO definitely can\\'t.For dieting for me it was about changing my mindset and habits. I used to want to enjoy every meal (still want to, honestly), but I’m trying to eat for health. So lunch might be boring but it gets me that much closer. And when I hit my goal weight I’m going to be able to eat 500 calories more than I do now. I also keep lots of reasonable healthy things to eat and try not to get too hungry, that’s when I make mistakes. The halo top stuff is good, I eat a lot of canned chicken and tuna, I’ve learned to be ok with microwave veggies. Also, if I know I’m going to be in a situation where I could screw up, (dinner party tonight) I’ll eat some chicken breast and fiber before. Not being hungry makes it easier. I also cut 100/week from what I was at till I got to my goal calories. I would figure out during the week what was going to go next week. Low cal mayo, no cream and sugar in my coffee, low carb wraps instead of bread, etc. planning is important. \\n\\nAlso, exercise will immediately add 4-5 lbs in water weight and muscle repair, just a heads up. I got a personal trainer and stopped losing weight for 6 weeks. I was still losing fat and pants got looser but it was real frustrating. Good luck!Depending on what stores offer in your area, premade fresh meals are my go too for easy meals.  They have all fresh ingredients that are mostly a protein with a sauce and 1-2 veg item.  One of my go too is salmon with a pesto sauce and veg that you heat up in the oven for \\\\~20min and its good to go.  Its easy to grab some frozen veg and heat it up with it if you want to add more bulk to the meal.  If your store has them prewash salad mix that you can easily top with feta, olives, tomatoes and a lite dressing great to add with the meal.I am also 1,78 cm and used to be 113 kg. I\\'m also stress eater or just use the food as comfort. I\\'ve tried and failed so many times. Currently I\\'m  on IF (alternate day fasting) and on my eating days I eat low carb (as keto as I can). \\nIn my experience, going low carb make make my fasting days easier (although I\\'m not suggesting doing the same, just sharing).\\nCW 93 and going down consistently. I also try to hit 10.000 steps, but I\\'m not doing this as often as I wish.\\n  \\nWhat I\\'ve learned through fasting is to recognize the difference between real hunger and just \"feel like eating\"... \\n \\nBesides I have no excuses with fasting... You don\\'t need any fancy ingredients, or money, or gym membership... It\\'s you against you... You learn that if you are overweight, you won\\'t starve for missing a meal or 2 every now and then... It develops discipline and that\\'s exactly what you need to commit this long term. \\n\\nYou can do this! Best wishes on this journeyYou got this shit king 🤴I did food prep, but we\\'ve been trying to sell our house and it\\'s been taking forever with a couple offers having fallen through, which is pushing off me closing on the house I\\'m buying.... all that (incredibly fascinating I\\'m sure) info really means is that my entire kitchen has been packed up for at least a month now, so food prep is out of the question, and I wasn\\'t much even before that to ensure the kitchen stayed clean for showings. \\n\\nI\\'ve been dealing with it by getting frozen dinners-- mostly Healthy Choice, some Lean Cuisine, and whatever else catches my fancy like frozen pot pies, frozen burritos, and frozen pupusas. Frozen kolaches and kodiak frozen waffles and pancakes take care of breakfast. \\n\\nI keep stocked with veggies that don\\'t need cooked-- carrots, celery, cherry tomatoes, olives, pickles, cucumbers, spinach, etc-- for taking to work for snacks/lunch or making into salads. I keep hummus (both normal and chocolate) and tzatziki sauce for dipping or making into a sauce, and a couple dressings I like. \\n\\nI keep well stocked up on fruits. I\\'m currently obsessed with Honeycrisp apples and Very Cherry Plums, cherries when they\\'re in stock, grapes, etc. My local store had fresh mandarin oranges last visit, which shocked me cuz I\\'ve only ever seen them canned. \\n\\nRitz Peanut Butter Crackers and the tuna salad kits stay in my pantry, as do Cliff, Luna, and Larabars. Uncle Ben\\'s 90 second rice packs work really, really well. Paired with part of a deli chicken and salad and you\\'ve got a fast meal.I use chopped salad kits, throw away all the extra stuff, add a lean protein (like deli meat chopped up) and Walden Farms zero calorie dressing. \\n\\nI also by frozen fish and frozen chicken, spread some tinfoil on the pan and bake. Through in some frozen veggies (microwaved) season to taste. \\n\\nNonfat cottage cheese mixed with tuna and peas or Oikos Greek yogurt is also a quick meal. \\n\\nSome I have no time to prep and I’ve been doing this for four and a half months. Works really well.I do a lot of food prep, but we have food intolerances and special diets, so a lot of prepackaged stuff doesn\\'t work for us.  I also cannot do volume eating due to IBS, so I have had to cut my portions down considerably to lose weight on what I can eat without angering my gut. \\n\\nI find that if I eat real good slow food, I am happier with eating less of it. I don\\'t wish to eat crap when I have the memory of something utterly delicious still lingering on my tongue.I think the most important thing when fixing your diet is cutting the bad foods out gradually. If you cut all of them at the same time, you will be more likely to binge on them when you get those cravings. \\n\\nFor meal prep, as many others have mentioned, there’s plenty of options now days on home delivery. For the sake of time and ease, those can help you control portions and get a healthy meal.I just feel like no time is an excuse. If you were dying, you\\'d make time to care for yourself ❤️ I do the healthy choice power bowls. They are delicious. I use 1st phorm chocolate protein powder. 1scoop of that plus 16 oz ice and 1 cup unsweetened almond milk. It\\'s so flipping good. I do yoga. It helps with everything. Core power yoga online is amazing. Way better than scrolling for hours on YouTube. The food thing is the main component. I intermittent fast. That helps. And some days I just eat one meal. It\\'s a numbers game. Fuel your body but remember your brain is like a screaming toddler and you have to parent yourself accordingly. No we can\\'t have fast food right now- we will eat when we get home. No you can\\'t go to the party without a plan for the day. Yes you have to drink your water. We take care of our body. It\\'s a lot. Start small. Celebrate big.I eat takeout but I just work it into my calorie allowance. I don\\'t know if you\\'re good at budgeting but sometimes it helps to re-frame your calories as dollars to spend. Start the day with 1500(or whatever amount) and stop before you go into \"debt\".I buy quesadillas from Aldi and have them for lunch.\\n\\nTry shifting your focus away from \"healthy\" at the start and focus on staying on track with your calories. :)Honestly.. just start working out. Once you’re consistent THEN start dialing in diet etc. you can simply eat “clean” and small meals until you’re ready. Jumping in full board has a very high “quitting” rate. \\n\\nAnd you only need 20 minutes of cardio preferably high impact cardio (rowing, CrossFit, cardio that integrates weight resistance etc.; burpees is the best if unable to access equipment) is the most efficacious. A minimum of (4x) weekly but daily or more won’t hurt just don’t burn the candle on both ends. \\n\\nGJ & GL!!I could never convince myself to take pictures. But a recent memory of a picture came up and couldn’t believe my eyes!For reference: 27F, 5ft2in, SW: 245 CW: 187 GW: 140\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/UjzgUUx\\n\\nHere’s a “before” pic, 3 ish years ago, (at my heaviest I was probably another 10lbs heavier than this picture.) and an “after” picture from the other weekend  \\n\\nThis weight loss is in a span of about 2.5 years, after gaining back (and THEN some) all the weight I had lost before. 90% of this loss is contributed to CICO, trials and errors, consistency, inconsistencies, shadow work, and the rest, to walking my doggos!\\n\\nI’m so much more confident and radiant ☀️ \\nWe can ALL do it!! 💪 I believe in every one of you beauties to blossom into the best version of yourself 🌻\\n\\nP.S. My most recent “NSV”, (not sure “victory” would describe it best),now that my butt has shrunk a good amount, I feel myself sitting on my “butt bones” more. And I’m having to adjust where I sit on my butt. I hope that made sense hahaI’m always amazed by the differences around the forehead and eyes. Hope you get comfier with your “butt bones” soon!amazing!!! I just also found out about r/petitefitnessCongratulations!!  What is CICO?Good job!Amazing progress!!!Amazing! You’re glowing!Seeing what progress should look like has motivated me furtherI had wisdom teeth surgery on Friday, so approximately seven days ago. My face swelled a lot, as expected. I haven’t taken a firm look in the mirror since the first few days of surgery until just now, and I couldn’t figure out what was different about my face. My family instantly commented that the swelling went down when I walked through the door today. I realized that my face is so much more defined than it was a few days ago, as it was very round and full. \\n\\nSeeing the definition develop back in my face made me realize that if I can lose the rest of these 36 pounds, I will have even more definition in my face, and I’ve always envied that of naturally skinny people. I want an angular face, because mine currently is somewhat chubby looking, and I think it’s due to being overweight. If I love my face more now than I did a few days ago, then I can’t wait to see the changes I’ll make in the future.\\n\\nI know I should lose weight for health reasons alone, but I’ll be honest, I’m in it for the looks. I want to look my best, and if being healthier comes along with that, of course I’ll take it. Just wanted to share. \\n\\n(Disclaimer: I loved myself pre-weight loss journey, but I do want to change my appearance, and I think both can be valid.)Why you lose the weight isn’t as important as just losing it. But keeping it off is what counts. So if you can do that, then call it a win.You never wear anything baggyBack in December, I bought a white hoodie that I absolutely adored. I wore it school one day and something happened where my friend tugged on someone’s sweater. When she tried to replicate it on me, she wasn’t able to because there was no fabric to grab onto. I remember her saying “I can’t grab it because you never wear anything baggy.” It was honestly a wake up call. In my head I went, “but I thought this was baggy?” I had always thought of myself as smaller until that moment. Since then, I’ve been working out and have managed to wear clothes and have appear baggy. It’s a small achievement but still a good one.Relatable! It was a wake-up moment when my favorite baggy sweater and hoodie were no longer baggy. Excited for them to be baggy again once the temps cool off in the fall.I did the \"these must be shrinking in the dryer\" lie to myself for way too long. That\\'s a great achievement and motivation!I\\'ve lost +/- 100lbs over the past couple years. Mid 30s Husband/Dad. In best shape of my life. Hope my transformation might be able to encourage others who are struggling.Been seeing a decent amount of posts where it seems like a lot of people are having a hard time deciding if it’s worth it to try and go for the big loss.\\n\\nI don’t like to post pics on Reddit and I’ll probably delete this. But if my transformation could possibly help a person or 2, I think I owe it to y’all.   Seeing transformations of others really helped my confidence through the process. \\n\\nI\\'m in my mid 30\\'s and I decided that I had to make a change. \\n\\nFat loss notes:\\n- Lost most of my fat by doing pretty extreme CiCo.  It may not be seen as super “healthy” but getting that fat off of your body and organs is incredibly important. \\n- drank tons of water constantly \\n- high protein diet \\n- I did some kind of exercise while dropping.    At first I’d swimming very slow laps or walking 1-2 slow miles a day.   (CiCo helped with fat loss way more than exercise) \\n\\nKeeping off \\n- lifting weights and exercising.  \\n\\nRegrets \\n- not lifting weights when losing fat. \\n\\n\\nWas it hard? \\n- yeah, it’s hard.  It’s not suppose to be easy.   Saying that, it’s only hard for a small portion of every day.   But everything else is so much easier.  EVERYTHING IS EASIER NOW!!!  (The work is truly worth it, I promise) \\n\\nI can go into more detail about anything if anyone wants to ask. \\n\\nPictures - https://imgur.com/a/AiduJbL\\n\\nEdit: \\nHT: 5-11\\nStarting Weight -  310\\nSmallest - 187\\nNow - 205\\n\\nEdit 2:    Thank you all for the super nice comments and awards.   I didn\\'t know what to expect and the positive outpouring has been fantastic. \\n\\nI am sorry that I didn\\'t get to everyone\\'s questions, I will try and reply when/if I can.Your after pictures made me smile with your big old grin. ☺️ congratulations on your accomplishments and good job on all your work!Holy!!!! You look like a completely different person! Amazing work- truly a huge accomplishment. \\n\\nFrom those photos it looks like your confidence has been boosted a ton and you’re out there living your best life, which is so cool to see. \\n\\nHow did you balance weight loss and parenting? Do you have a spouse/partner and were they supportive? I’m a mom of 2 and find it hard to prioritize and find the time to get to the gym and make nutritious meals so I always like to hear what has worked and is working for other parents.Nicely done man. Excellent stache too.Well done! You look fantastic and hella fineNice job, OP! Just curious though, why do you regret not lifting when losing fat?Right the fuck on man!!\\nWhat truly surprises me the most, is during all your weight loss you somehow managed to maintain that spectacular push broom located directly above your lip…\\nJokes aside, congrats man. This is awesomeOmg... I\\'m so happy for you and so happy for this community that you\\'re sharing this. It gives us all a lot of hope. There\\'s a lot of negativity out there but this post is so refreshing and inspiring. You look truly happy and sparkly.\\n\\nWhat you\\'ve accomplished is incredible. I hope you\\'re enjoying life and this newfound success!!!Amazing dude 👏What is CiCo? I’m close to your starting weight and same height and need to seriously work on my weight.My starting weight was 270 and I’ve lost 110 pounds in about 10 months now I think. I didn’t start exercising until I was 200 though, lol the weight was too much. \\n\\nNow I have muscle tone and feel great.\\n\\nThough my story is kind of different. I’ve had a food addiction I was in denial about for 10-12 years, maybe even longer. I had an almost traumatically bad LSD trip over a holiday weekend in September and it like made me face it and just deleted it out of my brain. I noticed the days after I no longer craved sugar or bad food and didn’t get any dopamine hits from food, so I just rolled with it. I’ve even eaten my old comfort foods and just, it’s like “yeah it’s fuel dude”. No happiness rush.\\n\\nDon’t take 5 tabs of LSD though and try to do what I did, god that could have went so badly lolMy man be thinner but that mustache looking thiccJust curious, but when you did extreme CICO, what was your deficit?\\n\\nETA: Amazing job! You look so happy in your after pics.Team Moustache DadYour kids will appreciate it and you are likely setting them up for a healthy life too! Great transformation!Awesome. Congrats for the amazing transformation.Congratulations and great post - thx for sharing!Congrats!\\n\\nHow many calories you were eating??My husband lost 100lbs before I met him, and knowing he had that kind of determination and execution in him was so attractive. Congrats to you for getting it off and keeping it off, what an accomplishment that will carry over into so many other things in your life!!Thanks for posting this. I’m on day two of my journey. You’re the first guy, who I would say that I can relate to. I’m 5’11”, 330. So similar starting points. Can you elaborate on what you mean when you say extreme CiCo?From Dad to Daddy. Amazing work!I was so happy for you until I saw the UF shirt… Go Noles! But in all seriousness, congratulations!First of all huge congrats but pardon my ignorance why do you regret not lifting while losing weight?You look amazing!You look great my guy! Go Gators!Yay!!! Congratulations!!!Great job, my dude! Also, go Texas!“It’s only hard for a small portion of every day” \\nTHAT is the phrase that I needed. Thank you.Really feel-good post! Well done and genuinely thanks for sharing!Just want to say that your transformation has definitely motivated me to keep pushing. Thank you for posting 😊Love this! Thank you for the encouragement for those of us in the middle of our journey! Love the everything is easier now!!!Loved reading your post and how you speak about your wife is just lovely. Proud of you!!Looking good, dude. You’re an inspiration.Great job, Pops!Amazing!Dude this is awesome!Your about my height so it gives me hope that you don\\'t have much loose skin. I\\'m about 255 - started my weightloss journey at 274.How much protein were you consuming per day? Congrats man and go gata! 🐊OP, good job! I love how you chased heath vs. aesthetics. So much more to life than how you look. Keep going!!Well done, that’s awesome! 😁👍🏻Amazing job! Wow, you are super motivational. Thanks for posting your methods and results - transformational :)What type of meals were you eating on a typical week?You look so happy now!I’ve lost a little over 50 now. Similar build as you, but started at 280. When did you make the change to focusing on building muscle? I’d like to get down to 200 and then do that but not sure the best way to approach in regards to diet (calorie count,etc).Hell yeah brother!You were handsome to begin with, but Jesus dude. Lookin healthy as fuckCongratulations on your weight loss! Can you go into more detail about your CICO approach? What was your caloric deficit throughout your weight loss journey?We have the exact same height and weight loss numbers! Had skin surgery and lowest I got to was 182, I generally hangout in the 190-196ish range.\\n\\nCONGRATULATIONS!!Damn daddy!Congrats dude you are an inspiration. Can you elaborate on the lifting weights part. Why do you regret not doing it earlier.Congrats man! Just weighted in and lost the first 5 pounds of my journey. Love seeing progress like this to stay strong, thanks for sharingThat\\'s awesome, thank you for posting! I\\'m the exact stats as you, however, I have begun my journey at 310 and now have been stuck at 260lbs for almost 6 months now - I do see drop in size (inches of clothes, clothes fitting better, more muscle definition), but haven\\'t been able to drop any significant weight. Did you go thru a plateau? Any suggestions to get over it?You look so young! And that lobster roll loooks so goodMy guy you are one handsome fella. Kudos.\\n\\nYour posts says it\\'s only hard for part of the day. Can I ask which part of the day? For me it often feels like it\\'s hard for the entire day.What is CiCoCongratulations! It\\'s stories like this that keep me from not giving up. Thanks for sharing your journey!Wow! U inspired me. I\\'m going to read this post everyday for motivation and encouragement! Thanks, GREAT POST!I seem to be getting distracted in the weekends during social events. I can keep track during the week and have cut in my breakfast, lunch and dinner. But the weekends keep sniping me down. How did you do that?Yah brother. Frig yah!Congrats, man. You look awesome - gains all over. I\\'m currently in almost exactly the same form as your before pic. Looking forward to when I can hit comfortably wear all the T\\'s that\\'re too small for me right now :Dnice stache man and congratulations. im working with the almost exact same physique as you. Just cant get my ass to work out, just eating less is so much easier for me. gonna hit the gym when im down to 80-85kg (175-187lbs), atleast thats the plan.You ever get late night cravings ? \\n\\nIf so how did you deal with them ?Great work!Wow you look fantastic! Great job OPJeez you look great!! Did you track protein/carbs/fat or just calories as a whole? How much of a deficit were you in? I really need to get on it and start tracking but I always say I’ll start tomorrow 😩My most successful weight loss has come on what would now be considered a crash diet. But as you note, it works, and you need to get the fat off your body, so barring a true extreme, doing it for a period of time can be helpful as long as you then transition to a more sustainable approach. But incrementalism can work against you- take 6 months to lose 40 lbs, or 3 months? Do it in 3 if you can. Progress on the scale and in the mirror is huge for motivation. During this time, the primary movement can be walking (this is coming from someone who has been big into weight lifting and high intensity training). Walking >> jogging/running for pure fat loss.\\n\\nOnce a big chunk of the fat is gone, add back some calories (protein/fat) and increase the working out so you can steadily get to your final destination. Then, pivot to whatever your maintenance is going to be.\\n\\nI remember when I first lost a lot of weight (senior year of college, 2001) I didn\\'t know any better and just ate a lot of rice, pickles, etc. Intuitively, I was thinking \"let\\'s get this damn fat off me.\" Subsequently, I \"educated\" myself to the point of fearing \"starvation mode\" and other stuff that just created confusion and ended up creating no margin for error without extremely precise tracking. Not my thing.\\n\\nFor reference, I\\'m 6\\'2\" and got up to about 210lbs. I didn\\'t carry it well, though. I dropped about 40lbs in 4 months. Was lean AF.  Then got into more of a maintenance mode and lifting weights more. Built back up. Corollary- i don\\'t believe in \"bulking\" either once you\\'re past the age of maybe 22 or so. It\\'s usually just an excuse to overeat and get more fat than the muscle justifies, unless you\\'re actually a competing powerlifter or something. \\n\\nAnyway, just some ruminations from a 43 year old who has made all of the mistakes over the years.\\n\\nPS- don\\'t drink alcohol. Took me until age 37 to realize that. Since quitting, 43 year old me >>> 28 year old me, even though 28 year old me was working probably 3x harder in the gym than I am now. Even if you don\\'t have a problem, think deeply about any alcohol consumption. Sobriety is a super power and eliminating it frees up lots of hormonal, calorie, sleep, hydration and overall health advantages that are pretty astounding.GO ASTROS!What were the foods, meals and meal plans that you typically ate during your CICO journey? This is where I need the most help. I would really appreciate any advice you can give me.Dude you are so awesome. Congrats on your hard work and dedication.Amazing progress! What routine are you doing for weight lifting?Bruhhhhhhh well done!!!!Congratulations, you look awesome! And Go Astros!Wow! You are glowing in your pictures! Great inspiration! Thanks for sharing!Amazing transformation!!!Good job bruhWow! You look incredible! Congratulations! Super inspiring. I’m down 30 lbs with another 30 or so more to go. :)Wow he actually handsomeAwesome job! I\\'m the same build as you and currently working on losing the weight as well. 33M, 5\\'11, SW 290, CW 265. Do you have to deal with extra skin? Honestly that makes me pretty nervous so was curious how it is for you being same build/age.Thank you. I\\'m struggling with motivation these past few weeks. Gave me the courage to set my alarm for tomorrow and go to the gym. And, of course, CONGRATULATIONS!!! Such an amazing change! :)Thanks for posting man. Our starting weight and body size are similar. I lost 60 pounds last year thru CICO. And now I\\'ve been snacking too much and gained back 8 pounds. Time to get back on track thanks for the reminder buddy.Thanks so much for sharing this.  We have pretty much the exact same starting Weight at 310, and my  next goal is 185 (currently about 215).  Planning on lifting more after I cut the last 30lbs, but you\\'re making me think I should start now!\\n\\nHow\\'d you design your lifting routine.\\n\\nAlso, your relationship sounds beautiful.  I\\'ve been going through ups and downs with both weight and dating lately, and it gives me a lot of hope/motivation reading about the healthy life you\\'ve built with your partner \\n\\nThanks for sharing!I know it\\'s not /r/fitness but I\\'ve been getting into some lifting (just dumbbells at Planet Fitness) and curious to hear what types of routines you followed - looks like you had success!What is CiCo?Amazing! You are radiating energy as if you mentally are carrying less with you as well. Your eyes shine like that. Congrats.Right on!  Great pics, thanks for sharing.  You look fantastic and very happy!This made my whole day. Enjoy your success and hard work. You completely deserve it! Very inspiring to read stories like this.Bro. Just awesome work man, awesome. Congratulations, you\\'re an official success story now. You look so happy too.'"
